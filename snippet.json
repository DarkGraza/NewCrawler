Vidya Balan will undergo rigorous training to play Silk Smitha in Milan Luthria's biopic Dirty Picture,  but she is seemingly nervous. Ekta Kapoor, head of Balaji Telefilms, is producing the film. And Vidya, who flew to Kolkata last week to shoot for Sujoy Ghosh film (untitled), had to sort things out with Ekta. So, hours before boarding the flight, she called for a meeting with her producers. It turned out to be a long one Vidya had a fixed agenda for the meeting, it was to lay down some ground rules for her portrayal as Silk Smitha in Luthria's film. And the actress put them across in her own sweet way but she was forthright about it. The following were Vidya's conditions: • That there be no clear display of heaving breasts in songs • That going backless is fine but she would not encourage frontal exposure • That there be no camera close-ups of any of her assets • That she is not made to wear outfits that may be explicitly exposing parts of her body. . Choreographers will be chosen only in consultation with Vidya.  Interestingly, Ekta Kapoor, who is otherwise considered to be quite a hard taskmaster, accepted all of Vidya's rules. Moreover, Vidya apparently had some rules on the way she will be choreographed in the film as well.  Says a source, “Vidya told them that the movements in songs could be suggestive, not vulgar.” As a result of this, two choreographers will now plan out all her moves in the film. One will be brought from the South film industry, while the other will be from Mumbai. While the producers were a bit surprised at the whole list of do's and don'ts, apparently they saw it coming. Adds the source, “Ekta and Milan will create a representation of Silk Smitha's character, without shades of sleaze. Vidya's final look will still be a shocker.” Vidya, who had recently said to a section of the media, “I have never defined my boundaries, roles or films as an actor,” is not always up to practising what she preaches.", "Published_Date": "2010-10-07T17:43:00+05:30"},

To win here is sensational.”Spanish rider Jose Joaquin Rojas of Spain was third. All finished in a time of 3 hours, 31 minutes, 21 seconds.Cavendish thought he could have timed his run better.“I didn't commit early enough, I didn't kick. I kind of rolled round the last corner, and kicked with 170 to go,” Cavendish said. “Greipel just came past me and beat me.”Defending champion Alberto Contador and his main Tour rivals—Luxembourg's Andy Schleck and Australia's Cadel Evans—all finished safely without losing any time to one another.Contador, who was riding with a sore right knee, feels he is getting back to full fitness.“I'm feeling better and better,” Contador said. “At the beginning of the stage, I wasn't sure what to think but as the stage progressed my knee was feeling less sore.”Schleck, runner-up to Contador in the last two Tours, remains 1 minute, 30 seconds ahead of the Spaniard in the overall standings, and 11 seconds behind two-time Tour runner-up Evans.Greipel looked tearful as he celebrated his win on the podium.Cavendish and Greipel openly feuded last year when they were both on the HTC-Highroad team.“He's the best sprinter on the Tour de France, and to be able to beat him is a big moment for me,” Greipel said. “The nine first days of the Tour were hard for us. We told ourselves that we had a rest day and we had to keep fighting.”Greipel was beaten to the line by Cavendish in the seventh stage last Friday in Chateauroux after being the one to attack too soon. This time, Cavendish gave credit where it was due.“Now I'm happy for him. He's come to the Tour de France and he's won,” Cavendish said. “I feel I made a mistake but Greipel beat me so there's not an excuse I can say.”The tense relations between them are improving.“We had a chat after the Chateauroux stage and he said ‘I have a big respect for your sprint,”' Greipel said. “He was not always really friendly with his comments (about) me. This is not my level.”An early breakaway of six riders was cut down to three when French duo Arthur Vichot and Sebastien Minard were joined by Italian cyclist Marco Marcato at the base of a short 4.1-kilometer (2.54-mile) ride up Cote de Villefranche-de-Rouergue.The peloton caught Vichot and Minard with about 17 kilometers (10.6 miles) remaining, leaving only Marcato in front.But Marcato's lead didn't last much longer. A new group of five, featuring the yellow jersey of Voeckler and green shirt of Philippe Gilbert, surged ahead in the last 10 kilometers (6.2 miles).Gilbert, the winner of the Tour's opening stage, then accelerated ahead as he went for a spectacular sole win. But the Belgian had far too much road left ahead of him and the pack soon swallowed him up.Norwegian rider Thor Hushovd, who lost the yellow jersey to Voeckler in Sunday's ninth stage, was briefly delayed near the end when he had to pull over to put his left shoe back on.Voeckler, who also wore the yellow jersey in 2004, was near the front of the pack as the sprint was launched and was happy to get to the line without incident. The first nine stages of the race were marred by heavy crashes and injuries.“The yellow jersey comes with a lot of tension, a lot of stress,” Voeckler said. “But in terms of the fans it's a fabulous thing.”  AP", "Published_Date": "2011-07-13T16:11:00+05:30"},

Mark Cavendish, Chris Foome, Ian Stannard and three-time Olympic gold medalist Bradley Wiggins were the others.However, Millar wasn't included for the 44-kilometer (27-mile) time trial, where Wiggins and Foome would ride for Britain.Like Chambers and Myerscough, who were named in the athletics team on Tuesday, Millar served an international suspension for a doping offense but had his lifetime ban by the British Olympic Association overturned at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in April.Millar will be competing in his first Olympics having previously served a two-year ban from 2004-06 for using the blood-boosting drug EPO.Under BOA rules he was banned for life from competing at the games, but the bylaw was revoked this year after being rejected by sport's top court, giving him his chance to go to the games.Millar had to overcome illness to be ready for the start of the Tour de France, Team GB said, but it still included him for the Olympics where he'll try to help Cavendish to the gold medal in the road race on July 28.Wiggins is aiming to be the first British winner of the yellow jersey at the ongoing Tour before returning home for the London Games. He'll also support Cavendish in the road race before trying for a fourth gold medal at his fourth games.The 32-year-old Wiggins has switched to road cycling after a successful Olympic track career, where he won successive golds in the individual pursuit in 2004 and 2008. He also was a gold medalist in the team pursuit in Beijing four years ago.“We've got a good chance to win the road race with Cav (Cavendish) and it's a London Olympics which makes it very special,” Wiggins said in a statement as he continued his Tour campaign in France. “I've also got a chance to go for my fourth gold medal in the time trial.”Steve Cummings, Ben Swift and Jeremy Hunt didn't make the final selection after they were in an initial eight-man training squad. Cummings, who rides for Tour de France champion Cadel Evans' BMC Racing team, had been tipped for a spot.“The final selection for the men's road race was a tough choice as we had a really strong squad of riders to pick from,” British Cycling performance director Dave Brailsford said. “We have selected the five riders who we believe are on the best form and will give us the fastest team for the race.”", "Published_Date": "2012-07-04T15:54:00+05:30"},

He immediately alerted neighbours and with their help, rushed her to Kokilaben Ambani Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.\"We used to stay in a 2 bedroom flat. We had two keys; one key was with Pratyusha and the other was with me. When I entered the bedroom, I found Pratyusha hanging from the ceiling. I got very scared. Immediately, I called the neighbours and with their help, I took her to Kokilaben Hospital. We assumed that she was alive, but she was not. I got so scared that I did not inform the police. It was the hospital authorities who informed them. After the doctor’s declaration, I called up Pratyusha’s family members and few of our close friends,\" Rahul said.While the location of the inquiry remains a secret, police said that they will scrutinise the CCTV footage where Rahul, according to Pratyusha’s friends, was seen slapping the actress.A senior police official said that they are recording the statement of Rahul in connection with the suicide and also checking the last call details and the SMSes exchanged between the duo. Although Rahul was not detained, he was brought to Siddharth Municipal Hospital in suburban Goregaon where the autopsy of the actress is being conducted, police said.An investigator said her death may have occurred around 5 pm on Friday, but details would be known only after the autopsy report is received. Singh will be taken to the flat for investigations. Police team is already searching for clues, but no suicide note has been found.Meanwhile, Pratyusha's parents reached Mumbai this morning to take charge of her body, but details of her funeral – whether it will be performed here or her birth place Jamshedpur – are not yet known.The glamour industry is rife with speculation about her disturbed personal life, her suspected uneasy relationship with Rahul and other aspects that may have prompted her to resort to the extreme step.Late Friday evening, the entertainment industry was stunned to learn of the sudden demise of Pratyusha, who was renowned for her role Anandi in the TV serial ‘Balika Vadhu’ with many even dismissing it as an April Fools' joke.Hailing from Jamshedpur, the 24-year-old actress was last seen in a role in another TV serial ‘Sasural Simar Ka’ and had earlier participated in the fifth season of the reality dance show ‘Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa’, ‘Bigg Boss 7’ and hosted some episodes of ‘Savdhaan India’.Prior to Pratyusha, several high-profile suicides of several young women rocked the entertainment capital of India, including the likes of Nafisa Joseph, Kuljeet Randhawa, Viveka Babajee, Jiah Khan, Shikha Joshi and Ruby Singh, in the past 10 years. ", "Published_Date": "2016-04-02T14:44:54+05:30"},

And of course, her enviable body.\r\rBut this time what stole Krishna&#39;s thunder was Tiger&#39;s reaction to her post.\r\r&ldquo;Nirvana state of mind,&rdquo; Krishna had captioned her super sexy picture.\r\rTiger commented with a &lsquo;nauseated face&rsquo; emoji.&nbsp;\r\rKrishna, responding to her brother&#39;s reaction, replied, &ldquo;@tigerjackieshroff Love you too.&rdquo;\r\rDoesn&#39;t this remind you of your sibling?\r\r\r\r\r\rKrishna&#39;s vacation photo album is full of loved-up moments of hers with her boyfriend, Eban Hyams.&nbsp;\r\r&quot;Always making me laugh. Grateful to have met my best friend, twin soul and love this year,&quot; she captioned the picture.\r\r\r\rKrishna Shroff and Eban Hyams have been dating for a while.\r\rHyams even addressed Krishna as &quot;wifey&quot; in one of his Instagram stories. This gave rise to rumours of an impending wedding, which were later rubbished by her.\r\r&quot;It&#39;s hilarious... Just a term. And it is crazy how there are so many articles saying we were secretly married. Even my mum (Ayesha Shroff) asked me what was going on,&quot; Krishna told Mumbai Mirror.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rTiger is currently shooting for his next project Baaghi 3.

Arjun Kapoor, who plays one of the five \"oddballs\" in the movie, believes Indian audiences are ready for such content.\"I was scared and apprehensive to begin with, but as the journey went on, I was more and more happy that I made the brave choice of doing an English film, which is offbeat,\" Arjun told IANS during a tete-a-tete here.Well, Arjun \"never saw it as an offbeat film\"!\"For me, it's a film which the country is ready to watch, and the fact that the trailer has received an overwhelming response is an example that people are willing to watch such content,\" he said of the over two million views that the \"Finding Fanny\" trailer garnered within two days of hitting online videosharing platform YouTube.Arjun is a happy and content young man.At 29, the son of veteran film producer Boney Kapoor has four distinct movies behind him. Starting with the 2012 movie \"Ishaqzaade\", in which he sported a rough and rebellious look as Parma, he pulled off a double role in \"Aurangzeb\", essayed the hot-headed Bala in \"Gunday\", and the nerdy yet affable boy-in-love Krish in \"2 States\".Arjun says he was surprised when Adajania, the man behind English language film \"Being Cyrus\" and the Bollywood saga \"Cocktail\", considered him for the role of Savio D'Gama in \"Finding Fanny\", especially after watching the actor's work in \"Ishaqzaade\".The fact that the forthcoming movie has a stellar cast comprising actors as senior and prolific as Naseeruddin Shah, Pankaj Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia as well as a glamorous star as Deepika Padukone in a de-glam avatar made the \"Finding Fanny\" journey all the more inviting for Arjun.\"It was almost like going to an acting class...having such fantastic actors around. The idea is to do something different, keeping in mind that you can get eyeballs with these actors who are a known commodity for Indian audience.\"Had Homi taken five unknown actors, it would have been a very niche film. But he has taken five known actors and set out to do something different. I think it's an intelligent choice on their part to mix known commodities with an unknown world,\" said the tall and handsome actor.Of course, Arjun stepped into the film clearly knowing that away from the commercial Bollywood potboilers that he's been part of so far, this one's going to have a limited audience given the fact that it's in English and sans any of Hindi cinema's song and dance routines.\"That's the amazing part about making cinema! People can have an opinion about it. I'd rather be part of a film about which people have an opinion than be in a project people don't notice.\"'Finding Fanny' is definitely relevant in terms of getting people to talk about it. If it does well, people will talk about encouraging young talent to make films like this. If it doesn't, then they will think how well did it do or didn't do.\"I think it is a talking point kind of film. It won't just come and go, which is what I like - it's got people talking already. And you can't always expect people to love everything you do...if they notice, for better or for worse, it's a good thing,\" said the actor.Presented by Fox Star Studios, \"Finding Fanny\" is produced by Maddock Films.

The trailer shows that the movie is the perfect blend of romance, fun and contentment.\"Premiering a film two weeks before its release has never been done before in Bollywood, but we are willing to stick our necks out.

And from the very first look at the trailer, the film seems to be catering to a niche genre of audience. Creating a whole lot of mystery and playing around confusions, Finding Fanny is a quest of finding Stefanie Fanny Fernandes, the lost love of Naseeruddin Shah. The other two characters in the film are Dimple Kapadia playing a modern aged woman who knows how to ‘protect herself,' and Pankaj Kapoor as an interesting man in search of love that he amicably finds in Dimple Kapadia. The trailer starts revealing that Deepika aka Angie has suffered a failed relationship as she says, “The first time I was kissed was on my wedding day -- 15 minutes before my husband choked and died. I'm a virgin.” The trailer of Finding Fanny slowly progresses towards the efforts of all the five truly unlike characters in finding Fanny Fernandes. A few shots also dig upon Deepika and Arjun's intimate chemistry but how far the film justifies their pairing is something to be seen! From the trailer, it is evidently visible that both Deepika and Arjun seem lost in the film and their odd pairing looks dominated by the acting prowess of rest of the characters viz Dimple Kapadia, Pankaj Kapoor and Naseeruddin Shah. The film that has been set with a typical Konkani backdrop appears to be lacking the grip. The music that surely entices you fits apt but the film looks more of an experiment. Watch Deepika Padukone, Arjun Kapoor, Dim-ple Kapadia, Naseeruddin shah, Pankaj Kapoor starrer Finding Fanny's first trailer here...      Directed by Homi Adjania who has also given brilliance in the form of Being Cyrus and Cocktail, Finding Fanny definitely cooks various interesting elements but all seems to be nothing more than a mere experiment. A 90 minutes film, Finding Fanny is in English and that's something that paves as a hurdle for the masses to accept the film. Though an appreciable effort, Finding Fanny appears to be taking a different stance on grooving serious realities of life. Deepika looks charming but not perfectly fit in her Goan character, Arjun is impressive but not upto the mark.

Very few actors get such an experience and opportunity... especially a son to play father to his own 'Paa'. We are only and perhaps the first actor father-son duo to have played themselves in a role reversal,\" Abhishek told PTI in an interview.  He said that 'Paa', where Big B plays a 13-year-old boy suffering from progeria, a rare genetic disorder which accelerates ageing, is a simple, light hearted and happy film.  \"'Paa' is not a film about progeria. It is a happy film about a father and his son and the sweet moments that they share,\" Abhishek said.  \"The genetic disorder is just the unique backdrop of the film... just like 'Mili' where my mother (Jaya Bachchan) is suffering from a disease but the film was not about the illness,\" he said.  \"There is a family in Kolkata where three children of a family suffer from progeria syndrome. But Balki did not want us to meet them and discuss their condition because it would have been very insensitive and intrusive,\" the Junior Bachchan said. Abhishek plays Amol Arte, a young politician and MP from Lucknow in the film.  \"I have modelled my look after Sachin Pilot and Milind Deora.  There were no special efforts taken for my look in the film because we wanted to keep the character as normal as possible,\" he said.   Besides, we had to maintain the uniqueness of Dad's look in the film and did not want to overload it with different types of looks for other characters, he added.  The actor said that Balki made him shave \"which I had not done for 5-6 years.\"  Abhishek also lost 15 kg when he shot for 'Paa'.  \"I had lost weight for 'Raavan' and Mani Ratnam took ill during the making which delayed the shooting schedule for six months. 'Paa' was scheduled to go on floors in December this year after I finish 'Raavan'. Due to the delay in Raavan, we completed 'Paa' during that period,\" he said.  On working with his father in movies, Abhishek said \"Paa\" is my fifth film with him. I am used to pressures of sharing screen space with him. I have never thought about the pressures and expectations as a challenge. I prefer using that energy to better my performance.\"   \"I got to spend time with him as for the last couple of years, my films have been shot outside Mumbai or abroad. Also due to the make up, it was easy to forget the real person behind the mask,\" he added.  On director Balki, the actor said that his approach towards life was very unique.  \"There is a freshness which can be witnessed in his films like 'Cheeni Kum' and this is evident in his direction as well,\" he said. He also said that 'Paa' was not inspired by Robbin Williams film 'Jack' where the character is 10 years old but looks 40, when he first goes to a public school. \"It is a fantasy film based on the character's experiences at school while Paa is a father-son relationship story,\" he said. Speaking about his experience in the film, Abhishek said that it was inevitable that his father will be best in terms of performance, more so with a new look.  \"But if the characters around him do not perform well, the world around Amitabh Bachchan's character will become unbelievable. It was a big challenge before me, Vidya Balan and Paresh Rawal was to be as convincing as possible,\" he said. Abhishek also does not see AB Corp as a full fledged production studio when asked about other projects in the pipeline, except for 'Paa' and Marathi film 'Vihir' which ready for release.  \"I want the company to be a small production house which makes films we believe in and make them well irrespective of the language. It is not necessary that the films we make will have a Bachchan acting in it,\" he said. The junior B has no plans to reduce his acting assignments and don the producer's hat.  \"I will not be an active producer but will have a say in what kind of films, the company will be making,\" says Abhishek, who is one of the directors of A B Corp.The actor is trained in production and has handled AB Corp's previous projects 'Mrityudataa' and 'Majorsaab'.  The actor is currently shooting for Ashutosh Gowariker's 'Khele Hum Jee Jaan Se' where he is paired opposite Deepika Padukone. \"This is a period film on the Chittagong uprising of 1930. The film went on floors last week and we are currently shooting in Goa,\" he says.   Abhishek said that Mani Ratnam's Raavan will release next summer.

The widowed life and relationship of a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is one of those rare topics which have hardly found place in our movies before.In one scene Savio Da Gama (Arjun Kapoor) satirically asks Angie (Deepika Padukone) ‘so, happy, just pressing your mother-in-law's (Dimple Kapadia) legs?” A kind-hearted and concerned Angie replies she is actually happy.In another scene we see Angie making an attempt for filling her mother-in-law's lonely life with joy as she asks Don Pedro Cleto Colaco (Pankaj Kapur) a painter by profession to join them as an accompany on a road trip.Adajania delicately presents their emotional bond and gives out a perfect outcome to that alongwith other such important issues of one's life. It garners a place in your wits and your hearts and you think over them again and again.Taking you on a little road trip which, however, seems to be limited to a circular area, the flick's concept aims at finding Ferdie's (Naseeruddin Shah) true love Stefanie \"Fanny\"  Fernandes (Anjali Patil) after he realizes that it was a failed attempt of proposing through a letter 46 yrs back.But in fact, it's an opportunity for all of them to find their soul mates since it's true that there's love for all and it's never late for them. The short narration helps the flick getting acceptable while clever dialogues and scenes serve amusement throughout.Pankaj's character is particularly comical and at the same time it also ‘paints' the psychology of such artists who are so freak in their art of work that they never compromise with their it.There is one scene featuring him, which is picturised unbelievably. I won't reveal it now and recommend you to find it out yourself. What also adds as a minor disruption is Deepika and Arjun's English slang, which sometimes becomes a bit difficult to understand. Watching the flick in Hindi would create no issues but sub titles in the original English version could have helped audience getting more comfortable.However, their performances are more favourable for the flick. Deepika as a widow is fantastic. She doesn't over somber on the demise of her husband Gabo (Ranveer Singh) and hers is the character who helps Ferdie find his love. Angie loves pampering all and Deepika's act brings out the right expression for the role.Arjun Kapoor as a hot headed car mechanic too is in the right form. As a frustrated and heart-broken Savio he does enough justice to his character.Pankaj Kapoor is phenomenal. While wooing the Rosalina Eucharistica as he calls her \"Rosie\", Pankaj is lustfully humorous. On the other hand, he is blind-folded and mad when it comes to painting as he accepts no negotiation even if it requires ‘Rosie' to stand like a statue in the scorching heat for all day long.Naseeruddin Shah as a shy and introvert lover looks innocent and brilliant. He loves singing as Deepika quotes him ‘a man with a golden voice', but that justifies him only until he croons alone.Watching Dimple Kapadia in this form is sheer pleasure. She loves donning those tight skinned clothes and is loud in her approach.Three stars for Finding Fanny. Take on this road trip along with the fantastic five and discover the little but essential philosophies of life.", "Published_Date": "2014-09-10T16:35:00+05:30"},

Know the reason and cure", "Author": "India TV Lifestyle Desk", "Content": "We are so engrossed in professional life that we tend to forget that prolonged exposure to computer, tablet or mobile phone can be detrimental to our eyesight, thereby causing blurry vision. Experts believe that one of the reasons for this could be the development of a condition known as the Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS).As per a recent study conducted by the Bank of America, a troubling trend has been witnessed worldwide, where people turn on their cell phones from the moment they are up in the morning and continue their tryst with digital screens till the time they are off to bed. However, the increased interaction with digital screens has resulted in CVS, a condition that damages the eyesight and leads to vision-related problems from prolonged computer, tablet, e-reader and mobile phone use.Victims of this ailment often complain of blurred vision, tired eyes, headaches, neck pain and dry eyes. While the complete boycott of gadgets isn't plausible, here are some useful tips to maintain healthy eyesight, as per Dr. Gowri Kulkarni, Head of Operations at DocsApp, an online doctor consultation app:-Be cautious of your screen time: Reduce digital eye strain by making use of screen time wisely. Keep away your smartphones and tablets before bedtime rather than staring at those screens in the dark. Try and make use of digital screens mostly for work-related purposes.-The 20-20-20 rule: As per the rule, in every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and focus your eyes on something at least 20 feet away. This will not only reduce eye strain but will also keep you active throughout your schedule.-Exercise your eyes frequently: Owing to the increased exposure in front of computer screens and mobile phones, it is quite likely for a lot of people to experience irritation or blurred vision on a daily basis. To avoid these eye problems, practice a few simple eye exercises like eye rolling, repeated blinking and focusing on a distant object to give some respite to your strained eyes.-Use appropriate glasses: There are computer glasses specifically designed to reduce eye strain, headaches, eye fatigue, and eye soreness. Wear them regularly if you're constantly glued to the digital screens. These eyeglasses are able to filter out blue light emitted from the computers, smartphones and tablets.-Adjust your screen settings: If the current settings of your laptop or desktop are causing eye strain, then adjust the screen brightness, contrast, and font size until you find what's best for you.-Ensure there is good lighting: Good lighting is essential at the workplace to avoid visual strain. It is also important to take measures to prevent glare, shadow and reflection caused by external sources of light, as these can contribute to eye strain. Keep bright lighting overhead to a minimum, use blinds to prevent glare or get a glare screen. Position the computer screen in a way that it reduces reflections from windows or overhead lights.-Rearrange your desk: If you are using a desktop at work/home, ensure that the monitor is slightly below eye level and about 20 to 28 inches away from your face. Ensure that you do not have to stretch your neck or strain your eyes to look at the screen.-Get a comprehensive eye test done: If you're witnessing recurrent headaches, watery eyes and blurred vision, then it is time for you to get a comprehensive eye examination done. Do not forget to inform your ophthalmologist about the duration of computer use at the office and at home.(With ANI inputs)For all news and updates, stay tuned to our Facebook page ", "Published_Date": "2018-02-18T12:54:07+05:30"},

Old songs still appeal to today's generation as they are melodious,” said Khan, who has also composed for the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra.  He said the future of Indian classical music is bright.“I have great hopes and expectations from the young classical musicians of today. The future of Indian classical music is bright.”There are many young talented Hindustani vocalists from Karnataka, where legends like Bhimsen Joshi, Kumara Gandharva, Mallikarjun Mansur and Gangubai Hangal were born, Khan said.  He said the younger generation of classical musicians are fortunate in having access to electronic gadgets, which were not available to yesteryear musicians.“Today's young musicians are fortunate. They have the means to follow any gharana by watching CDs and DVDs. The earlier generation did not have access to recording, video players and other electronic gadgets,” he added.  Khan, a Padma Vibhushan awardee, was only six when he gave his first sarod recital.The sarod maestro reminded young hopefuls that there are no shortcuts to become an established classical musician and said the Guru-Shishya parampara (tradition) is the only way to achieve and understand classical music.“To achieve something in life you have to surrender to your guru and work as a servant. Hence there are no shortcuts to become classical musicians. Guru-Shishya Parampara is the only way to establish oneself as a classical musician,” Khan said.Speaking about Mallikarjun Bheemarayappa Mansur and Gangubai Hangal, he said they belonged to different gharanas and both singers had different styles and nature.“Mallikarjun Mansur and Gangubai Hangal represented Jaipur and Kirana gharanas, different from each other.. Every singer has a different style and nature and the two singers were simple and kind,” Khan said.Khan also cherishes his visits to Karnataka. “I have always looked forward to Karnataka because the audience here is appreciative and cultured. I have performed maximum number of times in Bangalore and Mysore. Now I look forward to performing in one of the shrines in Gulbarga,” he said.He said he felt honored to receive the award, as Mallikarjun Mansur was a great singer and gave a different dimension to singing.", "Published_Date": "2012-01-03T18:25:00+05:30"},

The production marked the finale of a weeklong trip by the talk show queen and 302 U.S. audience members who took part in \"Oprah's Ultimate Australian Adventure.\"Winfrey's staffers whipped the already frenzied crowd into a tear-drenched state of hysteria before the host ascended the stage to the sounds of Men At Work's \"Down Under,\" Australia's unofficial anthem.\"HELLOOOO AUSTRALIAAAAA!\" she bellowed as the audience's roar reached a deafening pitch. \"Now I understand why you call Australia 'Oz,' 'cause we truly are at the end of the yellow brick road!\"Winfrey launched her 25th and final season of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in September by surprising her audience with her ultimate giveaway: an eight-day trip to Australia. For the past week, the lucky chosen have been traveling the continent -- snorkeling the Great Barrier Reef, surfing at Sydney's famous Bondi Beach and exploring the rugged Outback.Winfrey said she had long hoped to travel to Australia, and taking the audience with her made the experience even richer.\"Life is always better when you can share it,\" she said before the taping.Four shows from Winfrey's Aussie adventure will screen in January and are expected to be watched by millions of people in 145 countries.The state and federal governments have spent around $5 million on the trip, a price that has drawn criticism from some Australians. But officials and Winfrey herself insist the shows will bring many millions more in tourism publicity.\"It is immeasurable what four hours of a love festival about your country broadcast in 145 countries around the world can do,\" Winfrey told reporters.And a love festival it was, with Winfrey lavishing praise on her Australian hosts, the scenery and the citizens.\"You're so darn friendly, you must go to friendly class!\" she told the crowd, who were randomly selected from a pool of 350,000 hopefuls.Her first guest was Australian actor Russell Crowe, who gave a nod to the surrounding sun-dappled harbor and said, \"When you live in a city like this, it's not that hard to be friendly.\"The nearby Harbour Bridge had been decorated with a giant \"O\" made of red lights -- first illuminated during a fireworks display thrown in Winfrey's honor earlier in her trip.\"When we (saw) the fireworks and that 'O' came over the bridge, I went into the 'ugly cry,\"' she told reporters. \"That was a really amazing moment. I had an 'O' on the BRIDGE -- on the Sydney Harbour Bridge!\"The family of the late \"Crocodile Hunter\" Steve Irwin also made an emotional appearance on the program. Daughter Bindi walked on stage with a python named \"Olivia\" draped around her shoulders, assuring Winfrey \"She's really sweet!\" as the host tentatively stroked the reptile.Seven-year-old Robert Irwin told Winfrey he watches videos of his father -- who was killed by a stingray barb in 2006 -- every day.\"It's so good because it's like he's actually there,\" he said, reducing mother Terri Irwin and many in the crowd to tears.\"Living with Steve was like standing in a cyclone,\" Terri said, eyes watering. \"Then we lost him. It was like the wind stopped.\"Winfrey, famed for her giveaways, had plenty up her sleeve, including a $250,000 check for a cancer-stricken Australian man and his family, who have been struggling to pay their bills.Hip hop artist Jay-Z, who also appeared on the show, stopped by a local boys' school after one of their teachers wrote to Winfrey and told her how much the students loved the rapper. The students, most of whom are from low-income families, were invited to watch the show's taping from inside the Opera House, and a live feed shown on the stage caught their reaction as Winfrey told them they would all be receiving free laptops.\"Now, no excuses not to do your homework!\" Winfrey shouted as the students began leaping up and down, fists pumped in the air.She didn't stop there. After the crowd had danced itself to exhaustion during Bon Jovi's performance of \"Livin' On a Prayer,\" all 6,000 were informed they would be receiving a commemorative necklace made of native Australian pearls. (Cue the screaming.)Winfrey said she plans to return to Australia, calling it a \"magical, wondrous, wondrous place.\"\"It has been an experience unparalleled,\" she told reporters. \"I will be back.

His fault:  He had disobeyed his teacher who had asked him to stand on the playground holding his ears, reports Times of India.  It was the second period on Saturday at Hijli High School where Akash is a student. “Science teacher Amitava Midhya asked Akash three questions. He failed to answer one of them. The teacher then asked him to stand on the playground holding his ears. Akash, who was in his NCC uniform, requested the teacher to not send him to the field. He was ready to stand inside the classroom,” narrated one of his classmates. The teacher, however, was not ready for an argument and burst out in anger. “He started beating me up,” said Akash. After 10 minutes of thrashing, the teacher left,” said another of his classmates.    When Akash returned home in the afternoon, his eyes had turned red and swollen. He told his parents about the entire incident when he could no longer bear the pain in his eyes. His father Tapas, a smalltime trader, took his son to Kharagpur subdivisonal hospital, where doctors advised him to take the boy to an eye specialist. After a check-up, the eye sepcialist told Tapas that his son had sustained serious injuries in both eyes. He asked Tapas to take Akash to Kolkata for better treatment. “The doctor told me that my boy is losing his eyesight,” said Tapas.  On Monday, Tapas lodged a complaint with Kharagpur police and before that, informed headmaster Rabishankar Chatterjee. After getting the complaint, Chatterjee tried to contact the teacher, but failed. Middhya did not turn up at the school after the incident. “We have already served a notice to our teachers to do away with corporal punishment.

Moreover, the process can be completed in just a couple of minutes with no side-effects in most cases.Also, LASIK is a one-time surgery, and the corrections made on the cornea will last forever. However, some patients may require an occasional touch-up.There are three important types of Laser procedures: LASIK, SMILE and CONTOURA VISION. Contoura Vision (also known as Topography Guided Laser) is the latest and is now the most recommended laser procedure of all.Today we will be explaining to you about CONTOURA Vision procedure and why it is the most recommended procedure out there by LASIK surgeons.What is CONTOURA Vision?CONTOURA Vision is an advanced laser procedure which was launched back in 2015 and is technically known as Topography-guided Laser.CONTOURA Vision is an FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved procedure and is developed by Alcon (a subsidiary of Novartis).CONTOURA Vision makes use of advanced topography technology, which maps the corneal imperfections to provide a highly precise and personalized Laser procedure for individual patients.The topography results are mapped with the patient's prescriptions of eyewear to design an accurate correction procedure that is matched by no other laser procedure out there currently.More information about this procedure - http://www.eye7.in/contoura-vision-eye-surgery/Why do doctors recommend CONTOURA Vision?All the laser procedures are entirely pain-free, can be completed in just a minute or two, has little to no side-effects, and patients can resume their daily life as soon as they finish the procedure.However, doctors nowadays highly recommend patients to undergo CONTOURA Vision procedure mainly because of these reasons:CONTOURA Vision offers the best power correction of all laser procedures.CONTOURA Vision corrects not just the specs power of the eye but also corrects any irregularities in the cornea thus improving the eye focus quality of the patient. In comparison, all other laser procedures (SMILE &amp; LASIK) just correct the specs power of the patient.Traditional LASIK procedures use Femto and Excimer laser technology whereas CONTOURA Vision also makes use of Topolyser technology.CONTOURA Vision does the treatment on the visual axis of the eye which not possible with LASIK and SMILE, thereby giving much superior visual outcomes. Why CONTOURA Vision is preferred Over LASIK &amp; SMILE Procedure?Any laser procedure is not cheap, and people want the best possible result when they opt to perform a laser eye surgery. This is the very reason why people prefer CONTOURA Vision surgery than other laser surgeries.In comparison to all the other procedures, CONTOURA Vision can provide patients with a better sharp and bright sight. As per clinical test results produced by Alcon, patients who underwent CONTOURA Vision surgery reported 30 percent better eyesight than before the surgery.Clinical test reports from the United States shows that 92.6 percent of patients who underwent CONTOURA Vision surgery achieved an of 20/20 \"Normal\" vision which means that the recorded patients no longer had any issues with their eyesight.Even though theoretically the exact results of the CONTOURA Vision surgery is expected to show up in about 12 months from the operation, almost all the patients can instantly experience better eyesight with no side-effects.Patients who undergo traditional LASIK surgery often complain about issues such as light sensitivity, glare, difficulty while driving at night and reading. These issues are also significantly reduced with the CONTOURA Vision surgery. Should You Choose CONTOURA Vision?Traditional laser procedures like LASIK and SMILE correct your eye power problem which avoids the need to wear prescription glasses or lenses. Whereas CONTOURA Vision takes it a step forward and rectifies any irregularities which are present on your cornea which helps in improving the sharpness and focus of your eyesight.Even though CONTOURA Vision is highly advanced and efficient than other LASIK procedures, it may not be suitable for everyone. For example, any LASIK surgery, including CONTOURA Vision, is only recommended for anyone who is above 18 years of age. Moreover, patients who have specific vascular and immunodeficiency problems are advised not to undergo CONTOURA Vision. There are other criteria as well which determine whether a patient should experience CONTOURA Vision or not.Therefore, it is essential that you visit a certified LASIK surgeon to take an opinion on what kind of LASIK surgery you should get done to correct your vision. Once you get verified on whether you can undergo CONTOURA Vision surgery, make sure that you only approach a licensed eye specialty clinic with a trained and experienced LASIK surgeon operating.Final WordsWe hope that this article on CONTOURA Vision surgery, and why nowadays people prefer it more than traditional LASIK and SMILE eye surgery, was informative to you.

Bengaluru alone has nearly half of the urban constituencies (28), while the rest are spread across seven city corporations -- 43 city municipal councils (CMCs), 65 town municipal councils (TMCs) and 92 town panchayats (TPs).The result of Gujarat Assembly elections, held last year, showed that the BJP held strong ground in the urban areas, while the Congress garnered majority of votes from the rural segment. However, a similar pattern in voting is unlikely in Karnataka keeping in mind the results of the last two elections. The BJP, which came to power on its own for the first time in Karnataka in 2008 but lost to the Congress after five years in the May 2013 assembly election, hopes to make a foray into the south again ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. The party hopes to make up its possible losses in the north where it had peaked four years ago. According to ANI, the BJP won 17 out of 28 seats in Bengaluru. However, in 2013, the Congress 13 seats, one more than the BJP. In 2008, the campaigning was largely focused on the rural population, while in 2013, the focus was on the urban voter. The news agency says that while the rural population is looking forward to increased availability of electricity, clean drinking water, education and job opportunities, the urban voter is more concerned about commuting through the harrowing, traffic congested streets of India's IT hub.India TV’s Final Opinion Poll says that the Congress will win 96 seats, BJP on 85 and the JD(S) will win over 38 seats – the expected kingmaker on the D-Day. With no party touching the magic mark in the opinion poll, Karnataka is likely to throw a hung assembly.Here is what different opinion polls have their say on the Karnataka Assembly election results: # VMR Opinion Poll on KarnatakaBJP: 89Congress: 91JD(S): 40Others: 4# Karvi Opinion Poll on Karnataka​BJP: 82Congress: 96JD(S): 38Others: 8# CSDS Opinion Poll on Karnataka​BJP: 84Congress: 97JD(S): 37Others: 04# C-Four Opinion Poll on Karnataka​BJP: 68Congress: 123JD(S): 32Others: 04# Suvarna Opinion Poll on Karnataka​BJP: 102Congress: 72JD(S): 44Others: 04According to ANI, opinion polls suggest that the saffron party may secure a higher share of votes in urban Karnataka, as many feel that issues related to Bengaluru have not been tackled during the Congress reign, be it infrastructural congestion, growing traffic, pollution of lakes, inefficient management of garbage, delays in the Metro rail construction, all of which have contributed to a disruptive existence.In all, 2,654 candidates are in fray for the ensuing election on Saturday to elect the state's 15th Legislative Assembly.Of the total candidates in fray, including 219 women, 222 are from the ruling Congress, 223 from BJP, 201 from Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S), 1,155 Independents and 800 from other national, regional and fringe parties, according to the poll panel.The state capital and tech hub Bengaluru, which alone has 28 Assembly segments of the state's total 224 constituencies, has a total of 449 candidates in the fray. Of them, 37 are women and 412 men. Voting will be held across 27 of the tech hub's Assembly segments, after the election in Jayanagar was countermanded.A single phase polling will be held for the 223 constituencies, including 36 reserved for the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and 15 for Scheduled Tribes (STs). The votes will be counted on May 15.  (With inputs from ANI)", "Published_Date": "2018-05-11T09:00:21+05:30"},

However, recent studies may compel you to add more green on your plate as it has been found that plant-based foods lower the risk of chronic diseases, weight gain, etc.In a study of nearly 6,000 people based in the Netherlands, those who ate more plant protein at the expense of animal-derived protein showed a lower risk of developing coronary heart disease during a median follow-up period of more than 13 years. Kim V.E. Braun, Erasmus University Medical Center, presented the research at Nutrition 2018.Another study of 4,500 Brazilian adults found that people who regularly consumed more plant-based protein were nearly 60 per cent less likely than those consuming more animal-based protein to show evidence of plaque in the heart's arteries based on coronary artery calcium scoring, a measure of plaque buildup commonly used to assess heart disease risk. Dirce Maria Marchioni, Faculdade de Saúde Pública da USP, presented the research at Nutrition 2018.A research from the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health found that among South Asians living in the US, people following a vegetarian diet had a lower number of risk factors for heart disease and diabetes, including a lower body mass index, smaller waist circumference and lower amounts of abdominal fat, lower cholesterol and lower blood sugar compared to people in the same demographic group who ate meat.In addition, an analysis of changes in body weight among more than 125,000 adults over 4-year periods showed that plant-based diets rich in high-quality plant-based foods (such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables and nuts) were associated with less weight gain, while a higher intake of unhealthful plant-based foods (such as sweets, refined grains and fries) was associated with significantly greater weight gain. Ambika Satija, Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, presented this research at Nutrition 2018. Moreover, a study of nearly 30,000 US adults suggested that the quality of plant-based foods in the diet was more important than the quality of animal-based foods. Better choices in the plant-based components of the diet lowered mortality by 30 per cent while higher quality animal-based components had little effect on mortality. The beneficial effect of high-quality plant-based foods was even more pronounced among people with chronic health conditions.

Besides being good for your eyesight, this miracle food may also help to reduce the risk of developing fatty liver disease, suggests researchers in a mice study.Fatty liver or liver steatosis is a common liver disease and the most important causes are overweight and high alcohol consumption. Green leafy vegetables contain inorganic nitrate that can help prevent the accumulation of fat in the liver. \"When we supplemented with dietary nitrate to mice fed with a high-fat and sugar Western diet, we noticed a significantly lower proportion of fat in the liver,\" said Mattias Carlstrom, Associate Professor from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden.\"No one has yet focused on nitrate, which we think is the key. We now want to conduct clinical studies to investigate the therapeutic value of nitrate supplementation to reduce the risk of liver steatosis,\" Carlstrom said. The findings, published Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, also showed that a higher intake of fruit and vegetables has a beneficial effect on cardiovascular function and on diabetes.Leafy vegetables and fruits also led to reduction of high blood pressure and improved insulin and glucose homeostasis in mice with Type-2 diabetes.There is currently no approved treatment for the fatty liver disease, which can deteriorate into life-threatening conditions such as cirrhosis or liver cancer.The results could lead to the development of new pharmacological and nutritional approaches, the study said.(With IANS Inputs)", "Published_Date": "2018-12-18T19:02:59+05:30"},

Earlier in July, thousands heeded his call for mass prayer, an event many feared would devolve into destabilizing protests.\r\rHours after his followers occupied parliament, al-Sadr issued a statement on Twitter telling them their message had been received, and &ldquo;to return safely to your homes,&rdquo; signaling there would be no further escalation of the sit-in. Shortly after, protesters began making their way out of the parliament building with security forces supervising.\r\rThe incident, and al-Sadr&rsquo;s subsequent show of control over his followers, carried an implicit warning to the Framework alliance of a potential escalation to come if the government forms with al-Sudani at the helm.\r\rALSO READ:&nbsp;New studies provide more evidence Covid originated from Wuhan market in China\r\rAl-Sadr&rsquo;s ability to mobilize and control his large grassroots following gives him powerful leverage over his rivals.

When you want to lose weight, the first step is cutting down your high calorie food beverages and go on a healthy diet. Most of the people go for the conventional weight loss diet. It’s time that you add another food supplement to your diet chart. We are talking about broccoli. Broccoli is a great choice for the weight loss diet as because it is so low in calories that losing weight is not the only benefit that you’ll get, but there are other benefits as well. It is packed with essential nutrients and contains fibre. Here, we bring to you how broccoli helps in losing weight.Broccoli being low in calorie, helps you lose weight. 1-cup serving of chopped, raw broccoli only has 30 calories, while the same amount of cooked broccoli has 54 calories, while in return it provides you with more than 100 percent of your daily vitamin C and vitamin K, vitamin A, vitamin B-6, folate and potassium. Broccoli is rich in fiber. Fiber has other qualities that help you lose weight. As it absorbs water and expands, it makes you feel full and slows down digestion, which makes it easier to eat less.  Several nutrients in broccoli -- vitamin C, calcium and chromium -- may promote weight loss. The body needs vitamin C to synthesize a compound called carnitine, which is essential for metabolizing fats into energy. Calcium may reduce the production of new fat cells and stimulate the breakdown of stored fat. Chromium may impact carbohydrate metabolism and may boost weight loss, but more research is needed to verify its role in weight loss. Broccoli is a good source of sulfur-containing phytochemicals that may prevent cancer. Researchers are beginning to discover that two of these phytochemicals -- sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol -- may help lower body weight. Sulforaphane may exert a fat-burning effect by triggering the breakdown of fat cells.", "Published_Date": "2017-06-16T12:53:15+05:30"},

Your genetics might be a reason", "Author": "India TV Lifestyle Desk", "Content": "A specific gene makes certain compounds taste bitter, which may make it harder for some people to add heart-healthy vegetables to their diet, according to a new study. \"Your genetics affect the way you taste, and taste is an important factor in food choice,\" said study author Jennifer L. Smith from the University of Kentucky. According to the researchers, everyone inherits two copies of a taste gene called \"TAS2R38\". People who inherit two copies of the variant called AVI aren't sensitive to bitter tastes from certain chemicals.Those with one copy of AVI and another called PAV perceive bitter tastes of these chemicals, however, individuals with two copies of PAV, often called 'super-tasters,' find the same foods exceptionally bitter.\"We're talking a ruin-your-day level of bitter when they tasted the test compound. These people are likely to find broccoli, brussels sprouts and cabbage unpleasantly bitter; and they may also react negatively to dark chocolate, coffee and sometimes beer,\" Smith said.For the study, researchers analysed food-frequency questionnaires from 175 people (average age 52, more than 70 per cent female) and found that people with the PAV form of the gene were more than two and a half times as likely to rank in the bottom half of participants on the number of vegetables eaten.Bitter-tasting status did not influence how much salt, fat or sugar the participants ate.\"We thought they might take in more sugar and salt as flavour enhancers to offset the bitter taste of other foods, but that wasn't the case,\" Smith said.\"Down the road we hope we can use genetic information to figure out which vegetables people may be better able to accept and to find out which spices appeal to supertasters so we can make it easier for them to eat more vegetables,\" Smith added.The study is scheduled to be presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2019 -- November 16-18 in Philadelphia.", "Published_Date": "2019-11-11T18:57:56+05:30"},

The actress who was present in the court with her sister Rangoli Chandel claimed that Akhtar demanded that the actress should apologise to Hrithik Roshan in an earlier case. Her refusal upset Akhtar and in return, he insulted her modesty. The actress further said that the lyrics threatened her that if Kangana doesn&#39;t apologise, the influential Roshan Family which has ties with the government can get her jailed.&nbsp;\r\r&quot;We will not take time to put up impostors, then it will be open to the public to know that your affair was not with Hrithik but with impostors, then your face will be blackened, there will be so much infamy in the public that you will have no other way except suicide.

Military Diet is a three-day diet programme. Experts says that it helps you to lose up to four to five kilograms of weight within a week, and that too for free. It doesn’t require you to buy any kind of book, expensive food or supplement. The military diet is a low-calorie weight loss diet that is claimed to promote significant weight loss in just one week which is known by several other names including the navy diet, the army diet and even the ice-cream diet.Mehar Rajput, dietician and nutritionist, FITPASS, an app for fitness enthusiasts, and Sonia Narang, dietician at New Delhi's Sonia Narang's Diet and Wellness clinic, have busted a few myths about the military diet: * Myth 1: You are on diet for only three days.Fact: This isn't true. Though the diet plan is designed for three days, you continue observing your calorie intake for the remaining days of the week. This practically keeps you on a diet for all the seven days of the week. Though the first three days put you through a strict and controlled diet, the other four days are not cheat days. You need to eat in moderation, though this may result in mood swings due to low calorie intake.* Myth 2: You don't count calories in this diet.Fact: Whether it is a three-day diet programme or the rest of the four days of the week, you should eat in moderation. If you are switching one type of food with another, for instance salmon with a lean protein or non-vegetarian with a vegetarian one, you need to make sure the calorie intake is the same.* Myth 3: This diet speeds up your metabolism.Fact: Diet alone can't do that for you. Along with diet, you need to exercise regularly. There are stimulants like caffeine that can speed up the metabolism but that is for a short span of time. * Myth 4: Nutrition experts develop this diet.Fact: No one knows accurately about the root base of the Military Diet. Nevertheless, sources suggest that the design of the Military Diet came from junk mail, bulletin board, faxed from one person to another and word-of-mouth.* Myth 5: This is very healthy and nutritious diet.Fact: It is not low-fat, low cholesterol, or a low-salt diet and it is only a low-calorie diet. As a result, it is not a healthy and balanced choice for most people with specified problems including high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes and heart disease.", "Published_Date": "2017-06-08T14:29:56+05:30"},

In fact, subtle sensory stimuli like scents can be more effective in influencing children's and adults' food choices than restrictive policies,\" said lead author Dipayan Biswas, Professor at the University of South Florida in the US. The researchers discovered a direct connection between the length of exposure time and whether or not one will indulge. They also conducted a series of tests using a nebuliser that separately gave off the scent of healthy and unhealthy food items (cookies versus strawberries, pizza versus apples).The findings, published in the Journal of Marketing Research, showed that participants exposed to the smell of cookies for less than 30 seconds were more likely to want a cookie. However, those exposed for longer than two minutes did not find that cookie desirable and picked strawberries instead. The results were the same in case of the scent of pizza and apples.Since non-indulgent foods do not give off much of an ambient scent, they are typically not connected with reward, therefore they have little influence on what we order, the study noted.High caloric foods are high in fats and sugars and extraordinary intake of these types of foods increase your risk factors for obesity Type-2 diabetes, heart disease as well as cancers.", "Published_Date": "2019-01-18T13:06:06+05:30"},

Hope you are celebrating the international shame your hate filled rabble rousing has brought India!&quot; Bhasker wrote in her post on the microblogging website.\r\rAfter suspension from the party in Centre, Sharma unconditionally withdrew her controversial statement and claimed that her comments were a reaction to &quot;continuous insult and disrespect towards our Mahadev (Lord Shiva)&quot;.\r\rActor Richa Chadha questioned if Sharma&#39;s withdrawal of her comments could be even considered as an apology. &quot;Is it even an apology if extracted under pressure?&quot; asked Chadha.\r\r-with PTI inputs\r", "Published_Date": "2022-06-07T21:16:24+05:30"},

Playing in this knockout event after a gap of 15 years, Anand had lost the first game against Kovalyov and had to win the second to level score and force a subsequent tiebreaker. However, after 31 moves, Anand decided that he did not have much hopes of winning and offered a draw to sign his exit. This might well be the end of Anand's aspirations for a World Championship match in 2018 unless he gets a wild card in the next year's candidates' tournament. As per rules, one wild card is issued and if Anand gets that he will be back in the World Championship cycle. If not, the Indian will have to wait for the next cycle that will be for the 2020 World Championship. Things had not been very smooth for Anand here and it was another bad day in office. To win on demand as black is a very difficult task against quality opposition in today's chess and that was the primary reason for Anand's ouster. The English opening by the Canadian gave white a little advantage and Anand's attempt at complications did not materialise as much as he might have liked. Meanwhile, Grandmaster Vidit Gujrathi continued his impressive run and defeated Le Quang Liem of Vietnam 1.5-0.5 to enter the second round. Gujrathi drew the second game fairly easily and his win as black in the first game came in handy. GM B Adhiban played out a draw with Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia for the second time in two days and the two will now face-off in the tiebreak games. The all-Indian duel between S P Sethuraman and P Harikrishna also ended in a draw after a thrilling game to set up the tie-break games. It may be recalled that in the last World Cup Sethuraman had ousted Harikrishna in the same round. Besides Anand, defending champion Sergey Karjakin of Russia and Michael Adams of England were the other big names who were knocked out. Karjakin was outdone by his younger compatriot Daniil Dubov while Adams lost to Maxim Rodshtein of Israel. The World Chess Cup started with 128 players in the first round on a knockout basis with USD 1.6 million as total prize pool. Besides, there are slots for the top two finishers in the next Candidates' tournament. Each round has two games under normal time control followed by tiebreak games of shorter duration in the event of a tied result. Two games with 25 minutes each and a ten-second increment are played first, followed by two more games with ten minutes each and a ten seconds increment. If the deadlock continues the players fight it out in two blitz games of five minutes and if still tied, a final Armageddon game is played to determine the winner. Important and Indian results after round 2 game 2: Aleksey Dreev (Rus) lost to Magnus Carlsen (Nor) 0-2; Wesley So (USA) drew with Matthias Bluebaum (Ger) 1-1 goes to tiebreak; Lenic Luka (Slo) drew with Fabiano Caruana (USA) 1-1 goes to tiebreak; Vladimir Kramnik (Rus) beat Anton Demchenko (Rus) 1.5-0.5; Hou Yifan (Chn) drew with Levon Aronian (Arm) 1-1 goes to tiebreak; Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze) drew with Yuriy Kuzubov (Ukr) 1-1 goes to tiebreak; Bruzon Batista Lazaro (Cub) drew with Hikaru Nakamura (USA) 1-1 goes to tiebreak; Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra) beat Boris Grachev (Rus) 1.5-0.5; Jorge Cori (Per) drew with Alexander Grischuk (Rus) 1-1 goes to tiebreak; V Anand (Ind) lost to Anton Kovalyov (Can) 0.5-1.5; Karjakin Sergey (Rus) lost to Daniil Dubov (Rus) 0.5-1.5; Alexander Motylev (Rus) drew with Anish Giri (Ned) 1-1 goes to tiebreak; B Adhiban (Ind) drew with Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus) 1-1 goes to tiebreak; P Harikrishna (Ind) drew with S P Sethuraman (Ind) 1-1 goes to tiebreak; Le Quang Liem (Vie) lost to Vidit Gujrathi (Ind) 0.5-1.5.", "Published_Date": "2017-09-08T17:35:14+05:30"},

The two even hired a godown to keep the boy during negotiations.  On Friday, Prince, the son of Rajendrakumar Jain – a marble businessman and a resident of Dombivli MIDC – was kidnapped from his building complex. Police registered a case of kidnapping on Saturday after the family received a ransom call.Jain said, “The kidnappers demanded that the ransom be paid in denominations of Rs 1,000. They threatened to kill Prince if they didn't receive the money soon. At 8 pm they called to check if the sum was ready.”Prashant Burde, Additional Commissioner of Thane Police, crime, said, “The kidnappers didn't use their mobile phones - which would have helped us trace them. They called from PCOs at Thane, Kurla, Mumbra and Dombivli.” He added the ransom amount was brought down to Rs 30 lakh.The accused allegedly agreed to pick up the money at Dombivli's Dwarka Hotel at 12.30 am on Sunday. Jain was given a bag with a fake cash and police set a trap. “We were shocked when a young boy approached Jain and demanded the cash. Our officers nabbed him and he identified himself as  Rvi Naidu (name changed),15, a resident of Dombivli. He said his accomplice Kushal Jain(name changed)  had hid Prince in a godown which they had hired on Thursday,” added Burde.Police said Kushal(name changed), 19, is Jain's nephew and the brain behind the crime. He had hid Prince at a godown at Devi Chowk in Dombivli W. Police took Naidu there and asked him to call Kushal out. However, Kushal  got the wind of the plan and escaped to the roof.“Kushal threatened to hurt Prince if arrested. We surrounded him from all directions, blocking all escape routes. Then, Senior Inspector Rahul Yewale fired a bullet in the air to scare him,” said Burde. Police said Kushal fell off the roof and was arrested. Meanwhile, Prince was rescued from the mezzanine floor.  “Kushal is a school dropout and wanted to open a cyber café of his own. He targeted his relatives as they are financially well-off.

This was just one more than Anand's previous round draw with Hikaru Nakamura of United States. Yet again it turned out to be an exciting day with three decisive games for the second day running, only the winners were different than the first round. World Champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway scored his first victory at the expense of his last world championship challenger Sergey Karjakin of Russia, while Fabiano Caruana of United States put up a sterling show in the endgame to outwit Levon Aronian of Armenia and American Wesley So crashed through the defences of Ian Nepomniachtchi of Russia. Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France was the lone winner of the first round to survive the day unscathed as he played out a draw with Nakamura. With seven rounds still to go in the USD 300000 prize money tournament, Carlsen, Caruana and Vachier-Lagrave now share the lead on 1.5 points, while Anand, Aronian, Wesley So, Nakamura and Karjakin share the fourth spot with one point apiece. Svidler, on half a point, is sole ninth and two losses see Nepomniachtchi at the bottom, yet to open his account. Carlsen has not won a Classical event for over a year now and the World Champion looks determined to change that here. Karjakin was simply outplayed from an innocuous opening when he failed to spot a dangerous king side attack. Carlsen pocketed one pawn and wrapped it up in 42 moves. Caruana, however, had to toil for almost three times more moves than Carlsen. His epic duel with Aronian lasted 110 moves. The Queen's gambit accepted by Aronian led to a worse endgame wherein Caruana won a piece. However, things were far from easy once the American missed out on a winning continuation on move 41. It was a long drawn affair thereafter that lasted 110 moves.  Nepomniachtchi proved no match for Wesley So, who proved too good and scored the first victory with black pieces. Winning a pawn and reaching a rook endgame, Wesley was remorseless in this one-sided affair. Results round 2: Peter Svidler (Rus, 0.5) drew with V Anand (Ind, 1); Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 1.5) beat Sergey Karjakin (Rus, 1); Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus, 0) lost to Wesley So (the USA, 1); Fabiano Caruana (the USA, 1.5) beat Levon Aronian (Arm, 1); Hikaru Nakamura (the USA, 1) drew with Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (Fra, 1.5).", "Published_Date": "2017-08-04T16:23:06+05:30"},

After raising visions of a good finish, luck did not favour Grandmaster Anand much on the final day as he was first held to a draw by Le Quang Liem of Vietnam in the seventh round and then shared points with Fabiano Caruana of United States in the penultimate round. The Indian ace ended on seven points, coming through one win, five draws and two losses in the event that gave two points for a win and one for a draw. Levon Aronian of Armenia topped the rapid section with 12 points in all. On the final day, Aronian scored two good wins and a solitary draw. The American duo of Hikaru Nakamura and Caruana were right behind Aronian on 11 points each and Russian Ian Nepomniachtchi was fourth on 10 points. Lenier Dominguez of Cuba was right behind on nine points. Le Quang Liem and Sergey Karjakin shared the sixth spot on eight points each while Anand, Garry Kasparov and Navara David of Czech Republic share the eighth position. The event is still only half way through as the players will change gears again and play the blitz that will have eighteen games in all and the winner in the USD 150000 prize money tournament will be decided by the cumulative score. For Anand, the road ahead looks difficult but things can still turn around if he can start off with a few wins in the blitz. A five-point margin is huge and the turnaround can only happen with some massive scoring by Anand. Garry Kasparov was again the big news of the day simply with his presence. However, Kasparov, once the best player on the planet, could not keep pace with clock or pressure and lost two games besides getting lucky and winning one against Leim. It was a heartbreak for the yesteryear champion as he simply lost from a won endgame through a super-trick from David Navara in the first game of the day. Le Quang Liem dropped a rook in the next game from a playable position to give Kasparov his only victory in the event thus far while Caruana proved stronger in what was a tricky endgame in the final round. Standings after Rapid: 1. Levon Aronian (Arm, 12); 2-3: Fabiano Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura (both USA) 11 each; 4. Ian Nepomniachtchi (Rus, 8); 5. Lenier Dominguez (Cub, 9); 6-7.

Sleuths of the central agency raided the residence and office of the Bijpur legislator and his brother Kamal Adhikari's flat simultaneously, the CBI official said.Kamal Adhikari is the chairman of the Kanchrapara Municipality. The raids were conducted two days after the Central Bureau of Investigation had arrested Trinamool Congress leader Raju Sahani, who is the municipal chairman of Halisahar near Kolkata, in connection with a chit fund case related to Sunmarg Welfare Organisation. The probe agency had recovered Rs 80 lakh in cash, a country-made firearm and documents of properties worth Rs 2.75 crore from the residence of Sahani.\"During the day, the CBI officers carried out raids at four places of Halisahar and Kanchrapara in North 24 Parganas district, including the ancestral house of the Adhikari brothers and their current residences. The agency sleuths also raided house of the MLA's personal assistant in connection with a ponzi scam,\" the official said. The MLA's two residences in Lake Town and Paikpara areas in Kolkata were also raided by the central agency, he said.Speaking to reporters, Kamal Adhikari admitted that Sahani is his friend and said he did not know about any financial transaction of the arrested TMC leader.\"I don't know about Sahani's monetary dealings or the chit fund company. There is a political conspiracy against me and my party. The raids did not yield anything. I am ready to cooperate with the investigation,\" he said. Responding to a pointed query about whether Sahani has helped him buy his flat, the Kanchrapara Municipality chairman claimed that he bought the apartment with his hard-earned money. Veteran Trinamool Congress MP Sougata Roy alleged that the BJP is using the central agency to target his party leaders and intimidate them after the saffron camp failed to defeat the TMC in the last assembly polls.\"We have faith in the judiciary. Those who are involved in the ponzi scam will be punished and the truth that the BJP is targeting TMC leaders as part of its political vendetta will come out,\" he said.

{"Article_Url": "https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/world/gandhi-book-based-on-letters-in-archives-says-writer-3456.html", "Title": "Gandhi Book Based On Letters In Archives, Says Writer", "Author": "PTI", "Content": "London, Apr 3: Pulitzer prize-winning author Jeseph Lelyveld,  writer of a new book on Mahatma Gandhi that has generated a controversy  in India, says that his work is “not sensationalist”, and is based on  material that is already published and available in the National  Archives of India (NAI).Lelyveld's book, ‘Great soul: Mahatma  Gandhi and his struggle with India', is not yet available in India,  which means much of the controversy has been generated based on a review  of the book published mainly in Britain's tabloid ‘Daily Mail'.The  review, published on 28 March, said the book claimed that Gandhi was  ‘bisexual' and was ‘deeply in love with Hermann Kallenbach', a Prussian  architect and bodybuilder who became Gandhi's disciple in South Africa.“This is not a sensationalist book. I did not say Gandhi  had a male lover. I said he lived with a man who was an architect as  well as a body builder for nearly four years. The letters are part of  the Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (volume 96, to be precise)  published by the Government of India.They are in the Indian  National Archive. That particular volume was first published in 1994. In  other words, the material I used contains no news,” Lelyveld told PTI  by email.Much of the controversy has arisen over the conclusions  in reviews about Gandhi's sexuality based on extracts of his letters  published in the book. The extracts from correspondence available in the  NAI suggest a close relationship between Gandhi and Kallenbach, which  has been interpreted as bisexual or homosexual. The Gujarat  government has banned the book, while Maharashtra government is planning  to do the same.  Lelyveld has opposed the ban on his book, describing  the move as “shameful”.“In a country (India) that calls itself a  democracy, it is shameful to ban a book that no one has read, including  the people who are doing the banning,” he said.  “They should at least  make an effort to see the pages that they think offend them before they  take such an extreme step. I find it very discouraging to think that  India would so limit discussion,” he said.In the book, Lelyveld  writes that Gandhi destroyed what he called Kallenbach's “logical and  charming love notes” to him, in the belief that he was honoring his  friend's wish that they should not be seen by anyone else. He  writes: “But the architect saved all of Gandhi's, and his descendants,  decades after his death and Gandhi's, put them up for auction. Only then  were the letters acquired by the National Archives of India and,  finally, published”. Lelyveld adds: “One respected Gandhi scholar  characterized the relationship as ‘clearly homoerotic' rather than  homosexual, intending through that choice of words to describe a strong  mutual attraction, nothing more. The conclusions passed on by word of  mouth by South Africa's small Indian community were sometimes less  nuanced. It was no secret then, or later, that Gandhi, leaving his wife  behind, had gone to live with a man”.The writer notes that only Gandhi's letters to Kallenbach have survived.He  writes: “So it's Gandhi who provides the playful overtones that might  easily be ascribed to a lover, especially if we ignore what else the  letters contain and their broader context. Interpretation can go two  ways here. We can indulge in speculation, or look more closely at what  the two men actually say about their mutual efforts to repress sexual  urged in this period”.The book reveals the influence Gandhi had on Kallenbach.  In a 1908 letter, Kallenbach write to his brother Simon: “For the last  two years I have given up meat eating; for the last year I also did not  touch fish any more and for the last 18 months I have given up my sex  life. I have changed my daily life in order to simplify it”.Lelyveld writes: “Later it is Kallenbach who points out to Gandhi the insidious tendency milk has to enhance arousal”.In  the book, publisher Knopf says that Lelyveld “sets out to measure  Gandhi's accomplishments as a politician and an advocate for the  downtrodden-against Gandhi's own expectations and in light of his  complex, conflicted feelings about his place in Indian history”.The  publisher adds: “Lelyveld traces the roots of Gandhi's philosophy of  reform to South Africa, exploring in unmatched depth the campaigns for  social justice he undertook there, and chronicling his continued efforts  when he returned to India. We see why he became known as Mahatma -  Great Soul- but we also see clearly that he was unable to achieve all  the goals he set for himself and his country, suffering bitter  disappointment at this shortfall, most profoundly in 1947 when India was  partitioned”.

Sexuality is a cult for me,” Rii told PTI.In “Cosmic Sex”, which had its world premiere at the just-concluded Osian's Cinefan here, Chakraborty explores the possibility of using sex to achieve God, the connection between sex and spirituality. Chakraborty was inspired by the fakirs in Bengal into making this film.“I observed my director throughout the process of ‘Comic Sex'. Understanding him was like understanding the film, and my realisation was that I am among very few lucky woman who has met men like Amitav or Q (Qaushiq Mukherjee, director of another bold film ‘Gandu') who understands a woman than a woman herself,” Rii says.She feels the general Indian audience is scared of her films, because “I leave no space for their shame, I make them go nude with me”.Winning the best actress in the ‘Indian competition' section was a great feeling for Rii who says “It always feels great to be acknowledged.”In the film, 18-year-old Kripa (played by Ayushman Mitra) one night has a fight with his father over his stepmother.  There is an accident and his father dies. Scared, he runs away from home. The night throws up characters and encounters for Kripa—Devi the street walker, Jonaki her transgender pimp and Kripa is entrapped in the web of love, sex and jealousy.  He murders again. Jonaki dies. Kripa runs on.  At dawn, he sits by the banks of the Ganges. The serene river soothes his frayed nerves. A woman emerges out of the water. There is no end to this night. She is his dead mother coming alive. He follows her. She takes him into her house and adopts him as her son. She gives him a new life, another birth.", "Published_Date": "2012-08-09T17:55:00+05:30"},

I shall now have to settle the issues in Court,” he said.  Seeking to find fault with EC's decision, he said the Commission has “essentially washed off” its hands by stating that it has no power to de-recognize a political party for violating Section 29A-C of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and there was a need for hearings before taking a final call.“These sub-sections specify what a party can do and therefore by harmonious construction with the General Clauses Act it should be taken to mean that omission of any activity from those approved under these sub-Sections is prohibited.  “Hence this is an arguable point of law on which you ought to have conducted hearings and heard both sides,” he said.Swamy alleged that when AICC starts giving loans that ends up in buying real estate and public interests are to be safeguarded. “It is truly the question of interpretation as to the scope and your responsibility under the Model Code of Conduct,” he said.He also accused the Commission of adopting double standards, claiming that it sat on a petition seeking “de-registration” of his party following his remarks in an article in a newspaper.Swamy said the EC sent the petition to him for comments despite the fact that Supreme Court had earlier held that it had no power to re-register any party.  When he pointed out this, he alleged, the Commission “sat on his petition and did nothing whereas in my petition to regarding Congress' violation of the election law, you moved so swiftly that I wonder whether you had any time even to reflect on the precedents”.

However, a pro-Pakistan militant group HizbulMujahideen claimed responsibility and threatened to repeat the attacks in future. The two 'fidayeens' (suicide militants), who entered the Police Public School ground in the guise of playing cricket, were eliminated during a 30-minute gunbattle following the terror attack in which 18 people, 15 jawans and three civilians, were also injured. Five jawans and the three civilians were out of danger, officials said. \"Prima facie the terrorists don't appear to be local but from across the border and first impressions are that they are possibly from Pakistan,\" Union home secretary R K Singh said in New Delhi. In Srinagar, a spokesman from the Hizbul Mujahideen group called a local news agency to claim responsibility for the attack that began at 10:45 am and threatened more such attacks in the future. \"It was a guerrilla attack carried out by a special squad formed for the purpose,\" Hizb spokesman Baleeguddin said in a telephonic call to the news agency. Looking like other boys playing cricket at the school ground, the militants removed their jackets after they entered the field, lobbed several grenades and fired indiscriminately from their AK-47s concealed in their kits to inflict the causalities before they were killed in the gunbattle. \"Five jawans have been martyred and seven (jawans) have been injured,\" IGP (Kashmir) Abdul Gani Mir told reporters at the scene of attack. The school was luckily closed due to strike called by separatists in support of their demand for return of mortal remains of Parliament attack convict Mohammad Afzal Guru. The CRPF camp at Bemina is surrounded by the Police Public School and many government buildings. \"There is a ground for Police Public School in Pirampura police station. Now some boys were playing cricket there. The CRPF jawans deployed in the adjacent area were in the standby,\" Singh said, adding two terrorists carrying kit bags came, took out AK-47s and started firing and lobbed hand grenades. Chief minister Omar Abdullah told the state Assembly the strike was a 'fidayeen' attack. Today's incident is the first suicide attack in Kashmir in the last three years with the last such attack having taken place in January 2010. Meanwhile, striking a note different from the established line, Pakistan foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar has spoken of the need for an \"out-of-the box\" solution to the Kashmir issue, saying that militancy would not help in resolving the long-standing dispute with India. Khar, whose term will end on March 16 when the government completes its five-year term, made the remarks during a final brainstorming session with senior officials of the foreign office. She impressed on the need for an \"out-of-the box\" solution of the Kashmir issue making it clear that \"militancy would not help in resolving the issue while military power is also not an option\", The News daily reported today. Khar, who served as foreign minister for two years, said India was not willing to talk about Kashmir at the moment. \"In these circumstances, trade and business with India is the best way forward. As trade and business grow, the people in India would force their government to find some solution of the problem and it is the only way through which we could get some relief for the people of Kashmir,\" Khar was quoted as saying. She insisted that Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf's private visit to India last week to pray at a Sufi shrine \"proved to be useful since it came in the wake of tense relations\" between the two sides. Khar argued that Pakistan was not so weak that it \"could be browbeaten by the Americans so easily\". She said: \"We aren't that weak. We know how to get things resolved on our terms.

Vietnam-era peace activists, New York City seminarians and hundreds of fast-food workers bused in from Chicago, Nashville and other cities marched alongside local residents.Four days of events are planned. They started Friday afternoon with a march outside the St. Louis County prosecutor's office in Clayton and renewed calls for prosecutor Bob McCulloch to charge Darren Wilson, a white officer, in the Aug. 9 shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson. Wilson remains free and on administrative leave while a St. Louis County grand jury weighs whether Wilson should face criminal charges.The U.S. Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation of Brown's shooting which led to a nationwide dialogue about interactions between minorities and police.“We still are knee deep in this situation,” said Kareem Jackson, a St. Louis rap artist and community organizer whose stage name is Tef Poe. “We have not packed up our bags, we have not gone home. This is not a fly-by-night moment.This is not a made-for-TV revolution. This is real people standing up to a real problem and saying, ‘We ain't taking it no more.”'The downtown march came hours before the Cardinals game at Busch Stadium, just blocks from the protest route. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said the city had enlisted extra officers and was prepared for trouble, though he hoped for the best.Earlier in the week, a small group of protesters verbally clashed with some Cardinals fans who expressed support for the Ferguson officer outside the stadium.“What I ask is if people come to have their message heard, that they do it in a respectful way,” Dotson said. “And the same thing on the other side (from police supporters). Everybody has a right to have their message heard, whether you like it or not.”He said the city also will bolster its police presence when the St. Louis Rams host the San Francisco 49ers in a nationally televised pro football game Monday night—the same day protesters are planning organized acts of civil disobedience.The crowd Saturday was significantly larger than the ones seen at Friday's protests in Ferguson and Clayton. While the main focus of the march was on recent police shootings, participants also embraced such causes as gay rights and the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Police reported no arrests or violence Saturday afternoon.“I have two sons and a daughter. I want a world for them where the people who are supposed to be community helpers are actually helping, where they can trust those people to protect and serve rather than control and repress,” said Ashlee Wiest-Laird, 48, a Baptist pastor from Boston.The situation in Missouri especially resonated with Wiest-Laird. She's white and her adopted sons, ages 14 and 11, are black.“What I see happening here is a moment in time. There's something bigger here,” she said.Tensions have simmered since Brown's death. Residents were upset about the way Brown's body lay in the street for more than four hours while police investigated the shooting. Many insist Brown was trying to surrender, with his hands up.Residents also complained about the military-style police response to the several days of riots and protests that erupted immediately after Brown's shooting in the predominantly black St. Louis suburb where just three blacks serve on a 53-officer force.Organizers said beforehand that they expected as many as 6,000 to 10,000 participants for the weekend's events. Police were not able to provide a crowd estimate Saturday, but organizers and participants suggested the march's size may have approached as many as 3,000.Since Brown's death, three other fatal police shootings of black males have occurred in the St. Louis area. The most recent happened Wednesday night on St. Louis' south side when police say an off-duty city officer working for a private neighborhood security patrol shot and killed 18-year-old Vonderrit D. Myers.The white officer, whose name hasn't been released, fired 17 rounds after police say Myers opened fire. Myers' parents say he was unarmed. ", "Published_Date": "2014-10-12T07:16:00+05:30"},

Avoid these jewellery faux pas this festive season", "Author": "India TV Lifestyle Desk", "Content": "Decking up for festival or any ceremony is most of the girls' favourite work. We prepare in advance for the occasion by arranging the outfits and matching it with accessories and proper makeup. We tend to pay most of the attention to our clothing and makeup while neglecting the jewellery. Hence, we land up making some irreversible blunders. As per experts, over-accessorising, multiple hair accessories and out of trend pieces are some of the common jewellery mistakes that should be avoided this festive season.* Wearing big danglers with a neckpiece having layers and multiple bracelets is a complete no. So learn to keep it simple. Avoid wearing big earrings if you are wearing a statement neckpiece.* Don't wear multiple hair accessories. Too much stuff on your head looks messy. Your hair shouldn't be the first, second, or even third focal point. It should be your face, your ring, and your dress. Instead of using fresh flowers use artificial flowers or accessories as fresh flowers will be smelly and dry by day end.* Don't neglect the neckline. The right neckpiece can enhance your look for the day, and certain neckpieces highlight unique features or draw the eye upwards toward your face. Strapless and sweetheart dresses really show off your neck, shoulders, and chest, so play that up by choosing a neckpiece that falls just below the collarbone. If your dress has a high neck, you can balance and elongate the torso with a longer neckpiece. * A single jewellery piece makes a statement of your fashion. Refrain from wearing a heavy neckpiece with matching chandelier earrings. They're meant to be worn separately even if they came into your life as a set. * Never wear jewellery that is too tight for comfort. No piece of jewellery that makes your neck, arm or finger bulge out is visually pleasing, leave alone being comfortable.* Do not continue wearing precious jewellery without touching up its polish and rhodium once in a while. Like everything else, metal too is subject to wear and tear, it will fade, get bruised, probably even chip, or have the chemical reaction to perfumes or henna.Don't forget to enhance your look with the kohled eyes, blushed cheeks and right shade of lipstick.

Opt for a printed or a flowy bottom wear like nizami shararas, on rich fabrics such as chanderis, brocades to give an extra dimension to your regular outfit. Team it up with statement rings and bracelets to get the desired impression. The look reminisces the styles of the royal Nizams of Hyderabads* Creating unique styles with mix and match: Adding layers to regular attire can also work wonders. Wear your regular skirt or lehenga with heavily embellished pathani jackets or exquisite benarasi dupattas to create traditional yet the bohemian look for the festive. A statement clutch and a beautifully designed mangtika can create a style statement this festive.* Sync with double layered looks: Another trend which is picking up like a rage is the double layered looks available in different lengths helping to create one's own artistic reflection. Dramatically designed layered kurtis or anarkalis can be teamed with simple churidars bringing back the easy going styles of Peshwa dynasty.* Resemble of the glorious past: While everyone loves to create one splendid Nawabi look during festivals, intricately designed anarkalis available in wide range of colour palette will be a perfect piece. Trendy designs in form of zari, gotta patti works have breathed in a lease of new life to the age old designs recapturing the splendor of the Mughal era.* Bejewelled looks: While traditional jhumkis and chandelier earrings accentuate the aura of our traditional ethnic outfits, we will recommend wearing sleek modern stone jewelleries this festive as it will provides multiple choices in terms of colour palette to choose from. Trendy mangtikas, haath phools, statement bracelets, rings have also found immense popularity amongst modern women. You can also accentuate your look with kohled eyes and glossy lips. To gain naturally glowing skin for the day, avoid eating oily foods in advance and include more fruits and nuts in your diet.

On its part, the CBI, supposedly autonomous, said in a statement that the \"searches (were) in accordance with procedure and not intended to target any particular individual.\"M K Stalin, the political successor of Karunanidhi, described the raids as part of a political vendetta.

Kejriwal said that the entire operation was happening at the behest of the Prime Minister, who he claimed was unable to “handle him politically”. “Modi is a coward and a psychopath,” Kejriwal wrote on Twitter. Senior BJP leader and Union Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad hauled Kejriwal over the coals over his comments. “The use of the word ‘coward' is totally uncalled for, condemnable and shameful. I expect him being a holder of a constitutional position to tender an unconditional apology to PM Modi for what he has said,” Prasad told reporters today. The minister further said that the CBI had followed all due procedure while conducting the operation and that all necessary protocol was followed. “Which law states that if the CM's secretary is accused of corruption, the permission of the CM is required to conduct a search? It is only after an arrest that the Speaker of the Rajya Sabha needs to be informed of the arrest and the reason behind it,” Prasad said.The BJP leader also remarked that the AAP's reactions amounted to a “text book case of hypocrisy and double standards”. Referring to the arrest of another senior official of the central government earlier, Prasad said that the AAP had claimed credit for it. “Now that one of his own officers is in the dock, they are blaming the CBI. How can this be tolerated?” Prasad quipped.Prasad also took a dig at Kejriwal, questioning his self-proclaimed anti-corruption credentials. “You emerged as an epitome of anti corruption, as you yourself claim…and you are trying to shield an officer under clout only because he is Secretary to the CM of Delhi? Did you not conduct any due diligence prior to the appointment of your Secretary?

The investigation by Lashkar-e-Taiba is the first by a rebel group into a major killing since the rebellion erupted in 1989.Lashkar-e-Taiba is one of nearly a dozen rebel groups in Kashmir and has been blamed for several attacks in India, including the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people. India accuses Pakistan of supporting the group even though it is officially banned there.The report Lashkar-e-Taiba released Thursday said the group initially thought Indian forces and institutions had killed Moulvi Showkat Ahmed Shah to weaken rebel groups in Kashmir.“We initially thought that the Indian army and the (government) institutions had martyred him to weaken the movement and create misunderstanding between us. We had no idea that the killers would be within us,” the report said.Shah headed Jamiat-e-ahle Hadith, a puritanical religious group with nearly 1 million members in Kashmir. He was killed in April by a remote-controlled bomb rigged to a bicycle near a mosque in Srinagar, the main city in Indian-held Kashmir.Police within weeks blamed the murder on factional rivalry, arrested three people and accused a top Lashkar-e-Taiba commander of helping the killers with explosives.Lashkar-e-Taiba blamed two of the men already in police custody charged with Shah's muder. It said they were members of an almost-defunct militant group, Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen, which was believed to be close to Shah's religious group in the early 1990s.However, Lashkar-e-Taiba said none of its members was involved in the killing.

The festive season is signified by bright colours with hues and accents of gold. While comfortable clothing has been the preferred choice this year due to work from home; the festive season is expected to bring back bright colours and beautiful outfits. The pandemic has also given rise to conscious consumerism, wherein customers are more aware of their choices and the impact that they have on the environment.The fashion Industry globally produces hefty amount of greenhouse emissions every year. One of the reasons for this is that the vast majority of our beloved clothes are petroleum-based and made from fossil fuels. These materials require significantly more energy in the production phase and have a long degradation period, which is harmful for the environment.Nelson Jaffery, Head of Design, Liva recommends opting for sustainable natural fabrics like viscose and modal. These fabrics offer flattering drapes, beautiful colour selection and are environment-friendly.We have listed down some trendy outfit ideas for the festive season:1.Cropped waist coat with a Glitter SareeOpt for a viscose based glitter saree and pair it with a plain black or white waist coat. This trendy yet fashionable look has been sported by many fashion bloggers and is definitely not for the faint of heart. You can also add a gota belt to the waist to add some structure.2. Jeans drapped with a SareeThis sounds a little out there, but take your favourite pair of boyfriend jeans and pleat your saree and tuck it at the front. Take the remaining fabric around your back and bring it to the front to complete the saree drape. If you want opt for a sustainable denim option, Spykar Lifestyles offers denims which boast of the lowest water usage during production in the country.3. Sharara for the festive season!Shararas have been very trendy this festive season. This fashionably safe yet stylish look is a great option! Opt for colours like bright yellow, pistachio green or pink to feel extra festive. Pick out materials that have some gold accents! Your make up also plays a key role too; \"try a holographic glitter liner that makes the eye look like a reflection of water. The colors intertwine well to form a beautiful and graceful look when paired with the outfit,\" suggests Priya Sureka, Creative Make Up Expert at Enrich Salons.Dr. Maureen Lobo, Dean - Academics ITM-IDM further adds, \"Sustainability is the buzz word today as we are all concerned about the future of our planet and what the future holds for the generations to come.

Several policemen, lawyers and passers-by were among the injured.  Bilour said there could have been more casualties if the bomber had managed to enter the sessions court complex on Jail Road, a high-security area.   To a question about claims that India and the US were behind such attacks, he said \"no Americans or RAW agents are carrying out these blasts\".  There was no immediate claim of responsibility for today's bombing, but most of such attacks in the last few months have been blamed on the Pakistani Taliban. The group has carried out a series of revenge attacks since Pakistani security forces launched a massive offensive against them in the restive northwest tribal belt bordering afghanistan. Peshawar, capital of the troubled North West Frontier Province, has borne the brunt of the wave of terrorist attacks across Pakistan.  In the past few weeks, car bombs and suicide attackers have targeted public places like markets, police check posts and security facilities in Peshawar, including the provincial headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency. Hundreds have died in these attacks.  The sessions court complex is located a short distance from a hostel for provincial legislators, the provincial home department, Peshawar Museum, Central Jail and Governor's House.  The explosion sparked a fire that destroyed the auto-rickshaw used by the bomber and several cars. Officials of the bomb disposal squad said the head, legs and body parts of the bomber and parts of the suicide jacket had been found. Six to seven kilograms of explosives were used in the attack, they said. Police cordoned off the area and sealed key roads as ambulances took the injured to nearby hospitals. An emergency was declared in hospitals. This was the second time a court complex in Peshawar was targeted by a suicide bomber. On November 19, a suicide attacker struck the Judicial Complex within the city's cantonment, killing 19 people and injuring 50 others. Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani strongly condemned today's blast. He directed authorities to conduct an inquiry into the incident. PTI ", "Published_Date": "2009-12-07T15:01:00+05:30"},

This direction is for enhancing relationships, energy, and  peace.2. Flowers:  Always keep fresh flowers within your house, try and avoid keeping  artificial flowers. The best position to place fresh flowers is in the  middle of your house, say in the centre-position of your drawing room or  hall, as the 'Chi' coming from the freshness would flow in all  directions making them pure. In case you want to keep Artificial  flowers, as a permanent decorative, then position them in corners,  instead of centre as it would distribute negative, and dull energy all  over.3. Flute:  Hang about two 'Flutes' on the outside of your bedroom door. The effect  of 'Flutes' brings in the much desired progress in your personal,  professional, and social life, which leads to immense success and fame.   Hanging 'Flutes' in a criss-cross position within your drawing room  diminishes all kind of negative effects persisting in the house-hold.  4.  Lights:  Diwali is in itself a festival of lights. Lights indeed are an  intangible part of our lives. Illumination each corner with lights not  only provides vision but also enhances 'Chi'. Hanging a wide-glowing  light right at the main door entrance escalates the presence and  incoming of success, and immense fame. Keep in mind that the light  should be on 24/7, atleast at the main entrance,  5. Photos:  Living in a generation of Facebook, indeed makes us more conscious of  Photos and Pictures. We also love to decorate the house-walls with  photo's and paintings. A fact that has always been neglected is that  these lifeless painting and pictures have a very strong control on 'Chi'  around the house. Photos of Sinking ships, Icebergs, battlefield etc  should always be avoided, or else you could see your house turning into a  battlefield itself. Photos of twin birds, scenery, portraits etc hanged  in the bedroom or drawing room generates more 'Chi'. Make this Diwali the best day of your life with 'Feng-Shui'... Happy Diwali!!", "Published_Date": "2013-11-02T12:55:00+05:30"},

Over 40% of burn accidents are caused by pressure stoves,20% of it is caused by hot liquids like hot water, milk or a hot cooking medium such as ghee or oil. In houses without electricity, kerosene and oil lamps account for about 20% of the burns.  With Diwali round the corner the risk of burns and injuries increase. In 2012\"According to statistics, 38 per cent of injuries involve hands and fingers, while 19 per cent are caused to the eyes.

According to Experts, 40 per cent of those who suffered such injuries are children below the age of 14, and it is mostly boys in the age group of 10 to 14.PRECAUTIONSRemember - For a safe DiwaliLet's take a look at some of the do's and don'ts that will render this and any other occasion that involves fireworks safe.DON'T attempt to relight a dud. It could still go off and have even less of a wick. Let it sit for several minutes and then douse it with water.DON'T use fireworks or sparklers indoors.DON'T carry fireworks in your pocket. They're explosives and can go off prematurely even if they're not lit.DON'T light fireworks in metal or glass containersDO read and follow the label directions. It's a no-brainer, but you'd be surprised how often people ignore the directions.DO light fireworks away from combustible materials like buildings, trees, dry grass and other obstacles.DO bury your fireworks at least halfway down into a bucket of sand angled on a trajectory away from spectators and combustibles.DO have water handy (garden hose and bucket) to soak fireworks after firing.DO light a firework at arms length, standing back and keeping your face away.DO douse sparklers with water and allow them to cool in a safe place away from children. The ends of sparklers remain hot for some time, and will easily burn a child's skin, clothing, or nearby combustible material.DO arm yourselves in advance with information on how to administer First Aid kit to the injured person.First Aid - For Superficial Burns:* Remove the child from the heat source.* Remove clothing from the burned area immediately.* Run cool (not cold) water over the burned area (if water isn't available, any cold, drinkable fluid can be used) or hold a clean, cold compress on the burn for approximately 3 to 5 minutes (do not use ice, as it may cause the burn to take longer to heal).* Do not apply butter, grease, powder, or any other remedies to the burn, as this increase the risk of infection.* If the burned area is small, loosely cover it with a sterile gauze pad or bandage.* Give your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain.* If the area affected is small (the size of a quarter or smaller), keep the area clean and continue to use cool compresses and a loose dressing over the next 24 hours.    Seek Medical Help Immediately When:* The burned area is large, even if it seems like a minor burn. For any burn that appears to cover more than 10% of the body, call for medical assistance. And don't use wet compresses because they can cause the child's body temperature to drop. Instead, cover the area with a clean, soft cloth or towel.* The burn comes from a fire, an electrical wire or socket, or chemicals.* The burn is on the face, scalp, hands, joint surfaces, or genitals.* The burn looks infected (with swelling, pus, increasing redness, or red streaking of the skin near the wound).Understand BurnsIn burns, first the outermost layer is burnt and then the deeper layers. The depth of burns depends on the degree of heat and the time for which the skin was exposed to the heat. For example when the hands are burnt, skin on the dorsum being thinner may be burnt fully whereas on the palmer side the skin being thicker all of it is not burnt. Skin that is superficially burnt heals rapidly, while which is totally burnt cannot heal without a skin graft operation. Skin that is burnt partly still has some hair follicles, sweat glands and sebaceous glands will heal spontaneously in due course of time.  When superficial layers of skin are burnt blisters form (scalds) and clear fluid is discharged from the burnt surface. These burns are agonizingly painful but if complications due to infection are avoided they can heal fast (within a few weeks) and do not leave behind scars.  Burns due to flames and chemicals are deep layered and do not affect the hair follicles and sweat glands. In this case many nerve endings get damaged and therefore it is not very painful. These types of burns heal slowly and always leave a scar.Burns due electricity, radiation and strong chemicals and fire cause full thickness burns but as all nerve endings get damaged there is no pain. These cannot heal without skin grafting. If not grafted they will lead to considerable scarring and deformity.  Infants and old people succumb to burns very easily but in an old man of 70 years even 10% of the burns may be fatal.  It can be done within the first week especially for face, hand and joint areas and thus will help prevent contractions. This process involves taking skin from the healthy areas of the body (usually the thigh area, if not involved), meshing it and putting it on the wound. The donor area also heals with new skin growth. Earlier this technique was practiced only in Europe and America, but today it is practiced in India all over. The greatest benefit involved is that it reduces the chance of getting the infection.* Our skin is our greatest defence against infection as it prevents the infecting organism from getting in the body. The earlier grafting restores the skin; less will be the chance of infection.* Prevents formation of contractures and thus deformity.* It reduces the hospital stay and is cost effectiveBut like the two sides of the coin it also has some limitations. The greatest limitation is that it needs to be done in a good set up with good operating equipments and other facilities and also the surgeon should be well experienced in this technique.Everybody should be aware of the first aid procedures, as first aid given in time can reduce the severity of the burn appreciably. First remove the heat source, look for associated trauma and remove the non-sticking garments. Do not try to remove the charred clothing sticking to the skin. If the person's clothes have caught fire put out the flames by whatever means available. Lay him down quickly on ground and wrap tightly with any piece of cloth. Smother the flame by gently rolling the victim or by patting over the covering. Also cool water eases the pain, removes heat, and lowers the temperature in the injured tissue. This prevents further injury to the skin. In extensive burns cool for no longer than 5 minutes, especially in babies and children. Wrap the wound in a clean cloth and without any delay take the patient to the medical care facility for treatment. the face must be left expose to air.The most important thing regarding burn injuries is that 95% of them are accidental and can be prevented with care and precautions. Public places and factories etc should install proper fire alarms, fire extinguishers and should also be built keeping the fire safety norms in mind. At home extreme care should be taken while inside working in the kitchen or playing outside with the crackers.Diwali is the festival of lights and happiness and that is what it should be.

He made the statement on the first day of the party's two-day conference in Coimbatore, reports Times of India. As expected, the deliberations began on a fiery note, with Karunanidhi walking out in a huff, abruptly ending the executive committee meeting.  He indicated that he was willing to step down as party chief in favour of his son if it would help the DMK. But he also flashed the sentimental card to rebuff any challenge to his leadership. Making it clear that he was disturbed by Stalin's supporters campaigning for his immediate elevation to the top post in the party, the former CM said, \"If anyone here feels that I should quit, then I will do so for the sake of the party.\" \"You are trying to create a rift between Stalin and me. If need be, I am ready to quit,\" Karunanidhi said at the closed-door meeting in Coimbatore. Organized in Singanallur in western Tamil Nadu, which has a sizeable number of Stalin supporters, the two-day executive committee and general council meeting is the first big event for the DMK after the assembly election debacle. About 350 members participated in the executive committee meeting which kicked off the two-day deliberations, meant to be a retrospection of the party's poor showing in the polls.  Union minister and Karunanidhi's older son M K Alagiri, Stalin, grandnephew Dayanidhi Maran, who recently resigned as Union minister, and wife and Kanimozhi's mother, Rajathi Ammal, were among those present at the meeting. The deliberations began on a \"constructive\" note, with members, led by Karunanidhi, analyzing the reasons for the poll defeat and urging the gathering to equally share the blame for it.  Some speakers even demanded that the DMK snap ties with the Congress, describing it as an \"undependable ally\".  A member wondered why the party was still part of the UPA alliance when Kanimozhi \"continued to face the spectrum ordeal\".  Former minister and the DMK's Salem strongman, Veerapandi Arumugam, facing land grab charges, demanded that the party dump the Congress. But the first signs of trouble emerged when Stalin's supporters began to speak. \"At least fivesix members praised Stalin and spoke at length about the \"sacrifices\" he has made.  They said he was the only capable leader to succeed Kalaignar (Karunanidhi),\" a senior leader and executive member, told TOI.  As if on cue, a senior functionary from Theni, known to be an Alagiri supporter, rose to point out that Stalin only did what was expected of him. At this point, Union minister of state for finance S S Palanimanickam intervened and wanted to know why the issue of succession was being raised when the forum was meant for discussing restructuring and rebuilding the party.  Yet another Karunanidhi associate, former law minister Duraimurugam, pointed out that when Kalaignar was still the party chief there was no need to bring up the succession issue.  K Anbalagan, DMK general secretary and second-in-command, another Karunanidhi contemporary, declared, \"We cannot accept you (Stalin) when he (Karunanidhi) is here. If Kalaignar quits, then I will also not hold this post.\" He advised the gathering to leave behind the succession issue when they meet again on Sunday. He said, \"The main agenda of the meeting is how to rebuild the party and not to find Kalaignar's successor.\" Neither Alagiri nor Stalin spoke at the meeting. Meanwhile, the  DMK, at a crucial meeting of its highest policy-making body, on Sunday flayed the CBI for opposing Kanimozhi's bail in 2G scam case, saying that the agency's action was discriminatory.The DMK General Council remained silent on the party's ties with Congress. The party meet favoured bringing the Prime Minister under the ambit of Lokpal.", "Published_Date": "2011-07-24T14:03:00+05:30"},

Police requested them to stop raising slogans. Generally, such people (who try to end lives) are engaged in talks to turn their mind but here the crowd kept clapping and raising slogans,” he said, responding to an impromptu debate on the matter in Lok Sabha.To questions over the role of police, the Home Minister suggested that the police took prompt steps to tackle the situation by calling the police control room and ordering help from the fire brigade to bring him down from the tree.To emphasise his point against AAP, Singh referred to the comments made by an MP of that party that had he been there he would have cancelled the rally immediately.Many members were sharply critical of the police personnel present there for not doing anything as the farmer ended his life.Many, including Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge, sought a judicial probe to fix accountability, saying police is in a dock over the matter and it cannot probe itself.Such a probe was necessary as Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the police, which reports to the MHA, have offered conflicting versions of the event.Rajeev Satav (Cong) sought action against Commissioner of Delhi Police to send out a strong message to the force.Singh said the probe has been handed over to the Crime Branch after a criminal case under Sections 306, 186 and 34 of IPC was registered. ", "Published_Date": "2015-04-23T16:00:00+05:30"},

Some so-called secular parties spread hatred in the name of Hindu and Muslim to gain votes. But we believe that no party should do politics in the name of caste and religion but should instead do politics over humanity and justice,” Rajnath said speaking to India TV.  Speaking on the Kairana issue, the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister said, “Whether it’s Hindu or Muslim, it is the responsibility of the government to stop migration if it involves Indian citizens. Government should take this as a challenge.”   When asked to react on BJP MP Yogi Adityanath’s remarks comparing situation in Kairana with that of Kashmir in 1990s, Rajnath said he did not agree with it.  “Every place has different conditions. Conditions at one place can not be compared with that of another place. Whatever situation is created, they have different reasons at different places,” he said.  Asked to comment on BJP’s promise of “anti-Romeo squads” and the issue of “love jihad,” Rajnath said he does not even know what the term means. “I have never understood the meaning of things like love jihad. I do not like to discuss these issues,” the minister said adding that India has always promoted the philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family).”  I do not know what love jihad is, he said. Both love jihad and Kairana issue featured extensively in BJP’s polls campaign during first two phases of UP elections.  Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath, speaking at India TV’s Chunav Manch Conclave in Lucknow earlier this month, outlined his agenda for the polls, saying the Hindu exodus from Kairana, love jihad and women’s safety are few issues that will dominate the state elections. He has often compared Kirana with 1990s Kashmir when lakhs of Kashmiri Pandits were forced out of their homes by militants.", "Published_Date": "2017-02-16T20:54:01+05:30"},

Also, the wearing of synthetic clothes should be completely avoided as these are highly inflammable,\" Pinak Shrikhande, additional director for critical care at Fortis Hospital, told IANS.   He said despite measures being taken, if there are cases of burns then water should be kept handy to cool the burning sensation.\"The area of burn should be exposed to running water, after which only clear ointments like Neosprin or Silverex should be applied,\" Shrikhande added.The use of coloured ointments are strictly prohibited, as this prevents doctors from examining the depth and intensity of the burn.   \"A first degree burn causes redness and applying a clear ointment will help. In a second degree burn, the person may develop blisters, while in the third which is the most severe the skin is completely charred and could turn white,\" Kuldeep Singh, additional director for critical care at Fortis Hospital, told IANS.Hence, getting medical assistance becomes a must for second and third degree burns as ignoring deeper burns could destroy the inner tissues and muscles.   \"If the person experiences pain on the site of the burn, it is a good sign which suggests the burn is not severe. But if pain is not felt, then there are high chances that nerves must have been destroyed,\" Kuldeep Singh added.While burns are a major concern during Diwali, crackers also cause severe problems for people with respiratory diseases like asthma and bronchitis.Fireworks like 'phuljaris' and 'anar' include highly toxic heavy metals like copper, lead, zinc, sodium and potassium that can trigger asthma and cause severe headaches and lung diseases, apart from chronic coughs.   \"As the pollution level shoots up due to lighting of crackers, people with hypersensitive airways should stay indoors to avoid inhaling polluted smoke,\" Manav Manchanda, senior consultant (Respiratory Medicine) at the Asian Institute of Medical Sciences, told IANS.Eyes being a very sensitive part of the body, the hazards from crackers are also numerous; so doctors advise wearing glasses while playing with crackers as chemicals in them can cause perforation of the eyes and even affect one's vision.   Raj Anand, senior eyecare specialist at Vasan Eye Care told IANS: \"Chemical and thermal injuries to eyes are all time high during Diwali. Heat from the crackers can melt the cornea, an injury which is irreparable.\"Eye specialists also strictly restrict the use of contact lenses while playing with crackers.\"Contact lenses may cause irritation to the eyes if exposed to high heat for a long time. In case there is any irritation in the eyes, lots of cold water should be splashed and care should be taken,\" added Anand.   With the scare of burns and effects on the eye, crackers also cause serious injury to the eardrums; so wearing of ear plugs is suggested by ENT specialists.\"Besides damaging your hearing, loud noise can also affect your body in other ways. Exposure to noise can cause high blood pressure, difficulty in sleeping and mental health problems like anxiety, depression and headaches,\" said Lalit Mohan Parashar, senior consultant, ENT Nova Specialty Surgery.   In sum, the doctor's advice is simple : Play safe, be safe this Diwali.", "Published_Date": "2013-11-02T17:02:00+05:30"},

Speaking at a sit-in in Bannu city in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Tuesday, the hard-line cleric and leader of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) hit out at the prime minister for calling opposition leaders &quot;thieves&quot;, alleging that the &quot;selected&quot; government has offered National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) to Khan&#39;s sister. Rehman claimed the time for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government led by Khan was running out.\r\r&quot;The roots of this government have been cut. They have only a number of days left,&quot; Rehman warned. &quot;Imran Khan has given his sister an NRO. Give us a similar sewing machine which can earn you Rs 70 billion in one year,&quot; he was quoted as saying by the Geo News.\r\rNational Reconciliation Ordinance was an ordinance issued in October 2007 granting pardon to politicians, political workers and bureaucrats accused of corruption, embezzlement, money laundering, murder, and terrorism.\r\rRehman said Khan was trying to be the &quot;Gorbachev of Pakistan&quot;. He used the same expression to describe Khan earlier this month when he gave the prime minister two days deadline to tender his resignation.\r\rThe JUI-F chief was responding to Khan&#39;s tirade from the previous day where he labelled Rehman&#39;s anti-government protest as a &quot;circus&quot;.\r\rPrime Minister Khan said on Monday that a &quot;circus&quot; took place in Islamabad in the name of &#39;Azadi March&#39; protest. He said the protesters could not even stay for a month in the capital as opposed to his party&#39;s 2014 protest of 126 days. Khan said the opposition leaders had ulterior motives, which is why they resorted to dharna politics on containers.\r\rEarlier, Rehman led a massive anti-government protest rally, dubbed &#39;Azadi March&#39;, aimed at toppling the incumbent government. The firebrand cleric had lambasted the government for failing on key domestic and foreign policy fronts. He said only Pakistan&#39;s economy was going down whereas the economies of all other regional countries were going up.\r\rRehman launched his protest on October 27 from Karachi and arrived in Islamabad on October 31, leading a caravan of tens of thousands of followers.\rHe repeatedly said that the protestors would stay until Khan resigned and new elections were announced. The government also engaged him in talks but failed to make any headway as he refused to budge from the key demand of resignation of the Prime Minister. Despite failure to achieve the objective immediately, it is believed that he gained politically by showing his power to assemble large crowds. The discipline and peace of the protestors were also acknowledged even by his opponents.\r\rThe opposition parties, including the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan People Party (PPP), had also thrown their weight behind the massive anti-government rally comprising thousands of protesters in Islamabad.

BJP legislature party leader Hukum Singh was also arrested at Ghaziabad border Saturday evening.Meerut police chief Deepak Kumar said security has been beefed up in the entire region following the arrests.The arrests came after BJP lawmaker Suresh Rana was arrested in Lucknow Friday.BJP president Rajnath Singh Saturday called off his visit to violence-hit Muzaffarnagar district, and said in Delhi that whenever the Samajwadi Party (SP) comes to power, “a series of communal riots begin in Uttar Pradesh”.Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh, who was in Lucknow, said the Muzaffarnagar riots were a “big blot” on Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and his government, and charged them with not responding to them properly.

Investigations revealed the video was three-years old about an incident in Pakistan. Som is accused of doctoring it and claiming it to be a local one.He has denied the charges.Rana, Saleem and Hukum Singh were arrested for allegedly making provocative speeches in the run up to the communal clashes.The opposition continued to blame the Samajwadi Party.BJP president Rajnath Singh was quick to blame the Samajwadi Party for the violence in Muzaffarnagar.”If we see the history of riots, then we can see that whenever the Samajwadi Party (SP) comes to power, a series of communal riots begin in Uttar Pradesh,” he said after he was requested by District Magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma not to come to Muzaffarnagar city.In a fax letter sent to the BJP president's office, the DM urged him not to pay a visit to the area as it could disturb calm and peace that is prevailing in the area after a string of violent clashes and incidents since Sep 7.Rajnath Singh accused the Akhilesh Yadav government of arresting innocent people in order to veil their involvement in the act of violence.”The sting operation by a television channel clearly proves that the people who are present inside the government have a hand in the riots, so why are they only arresting the BJP legislators?” he asked.Rajnath Singh said the situation in Muzaffarnagar is like during the period of emergency, and said BJP leaders will meet President Pranab Mukherjee Sep 24.He also said BJP legislators were not in any way involved in inciting violence when communal riots broke out in Muzaffarnagar Sep 7, leaving 48 dead and over 40,000 homeless.Ramesh said there was hope when Akhilesh Yadav took over as the state chief minister but all those hopes have now been dashed.”Akhilesh is a friend but I have to say that the riots are a big blot on his government and on his very own administrative acumen,” he said. ", "Published_Date": "2013-09-21T23:43:00+05:30"},

Can any state government take a decision like this? This kind of decision they have taken is anti-national.”He said the central government “should immediately direct the state government to correct this. I am still in shock after hearing about this. No government in India has the right to do that. This is a very senseless decision which they have taken.”His party colleague and Congress spokesman Anand Sharma also said no state government can do it because it is a national holiday.“They can't do it. Gandhi is the father of nation. Even last year children were asked to go to school on October 2,” Sharma said.RSS refused to be drawn into the controversy but said the number of holidays in the country should come down for improved work culture.“I don't know the reasons for this decision. We will see why it happened. But, according to a survey, people in India hardly work for 150-155 days a year on account of holidays.Their number must come down for better work culture,” RSS General Secretary Suresh Joshi said in Nagpur when asked about the Goa government's decision.Seeking to douse the angry reactions, the Chief Minister said,”it could be a typing mistake. It is not an intentional mistake.”Gandhi Jayanti has been celebrated all over the country for decades, with the entire nation gratefully recalling the services of the Mahatma, who led the struggle against the British rule through non-violent means. The list has retained all other holidays.Independent opposition legislator Vijay Sardesai said, “Is this nationalismor the BJP's sense of civility?” Condemning the decision, Goa's lone Rajya Sabha member Shantaram Naik said BJP leaders claim they hold Gandhi in high esteem and started worshipping him in recent times, but actually denigrate him on every available opportunity.Naik alleged that in the name of ‘Swachh Bharat', BJP perhaps wants to obliterate the name of Gandhi in whatever form it exists, adding that he would raise the issue in Rajya Sabha tomorrow.When Manohar Parrikar was Chief Minister of Goa, the government had sought to scrap a few public holidays, including Gandhi Jayanti, Good Friday and Old Goa Feast, but had to give up the move due to public outcry.", "Published_Date": "2015-03-15T18:59:00+05:30"},

It is certain,\" a government official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.Lawyers for the 65-year-old dissident say her current term of house arrest started with her imprisonment on May 14 last year and so is due to end on Saturday.\"She will be released for sure as planned,\" said another government official who also declined to be named. Suu Kyi's detention was extended by 18 months in August last year over a bizarre incident in which an American swam uninvited to her lakeside home, keeping her off the scene for the first election in 20 years. Her supporters said they expected her to be released but were still awaiting confirmation from the authorities. \"They cannot extend her detention according to the law,\" said one of her lawyers, Nyan Win. \"They should release her for the country.\"  The daughter of Myanmar's founding father General Aung San swept her National League for Democracy (NLD) to victory in elections two decades ago, but the party was never allowed to take power.Her supporters have said she will hold a news conference at the NLD's headquarters if freed, suggesting she is likely to resist any attempt by the authorities to rein in her political activities.Some observers believe her release could come with restrictions to ensure she cannot threaten the generals' hold on power.Nyan Win has suggested she would refuse to accept any conditions on her release, as in the past when she tried in vain to leave Yangon in defiance of the junta's orders.Dozens of supporters gathered at the NLD's headquarters, where a banner hung alongside two portraits of their leader read: \"The time is here for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi.\"Some NLD members were planning to donate blood to a local hospital to mark her release.", "Published_Date": "2010-11-12T17:59:00+05:30"},

Sangeet Som, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Sardhana, surrendered in Salawa village of Meerut, while Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) lawmaker Noor Saleem Rana was also arrested hours later from Meerut. BJP legislature party leader Hukum Singh was also arrested at Ghaziabad border Saturday evening.Meerut police chief Deepak Kumar said security has been beefed up in the entire region following the arrests.The arrests came after BJP lawmaker Suresh Rana was arrested in Lucknow Friday.BJP president Rajnath Singh Saturday called off his visit to violence-hit Muzaffarnagar district, and said in Delhi that whenever the Samajwadi Party (SP) comes to power, “a series of communal riots begin in Uttar Pradesh”.Union Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh, who was in Lucknow, said the Muzaffarnagar riots were a “big blot” on Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and his government, and charged them with not responding to them properly. A court later sent Som, Saleem Rana, and Rana to 14 days judicial custody when police produced the trio in execution of a non-bailable warrants issued by it earlier. The 16 political leaders against whom warrants have been issued include BSP MP Qadir Rana, BJP legislator Bhartendu Singh, BSP legislator Maulana Jameel, Congress leader Saeeduzaman and Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) chief Naresh Tikait.Som was sent to Orai prison, Saleem Rana packed off to the Mirzapur jail and Rana sent to the Banda jail.Som has been booked on charges of making and distributing a fake CD that showed a man being lynched. Investigations revealed the video was three-years old about an incident in Pakistan. Som is accused of doctoring it and claiming it to be a local one.He has denied the charges.Rana, Saleem and Hukum Singh were arrested for allegedly making provocative speeches in the run up to the communal clashes.The opposition continued to blame the Samajwadi Party.BJP president Rajnath Singh was quick to blame the Samajwadi Party for the violence in Muzaffarnagar.”If we see the history of riots, then we can see that whenever the Samajwadi Party (SP) comes to power, a series of communal riots begin in Uttar Pradesh,” he said after he was requested by District Magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma not to come to Muzaffarnagar city.In a fax letter sent to the BJP president's office, the DM urged him not to pay a visit to the area as it could disturb calm and peace that is prevailing in the area after a string of violent clashes and incidents since Sep 7.Rajnath Singh accused the Akhilesh Yadav government of arresting innocent people in order to veil their involvement in the act of violence.”The sting operation by a television channel clearly proves that the people who are present inside the government have a hand in the riots, so why are they only arresting the BJP legislators?” he asked.Rajnath Singh said the situation in Muzaffarnagar is like during the period of emergency, and said BJP leaders will meet President Pranab Mukherjee Sep 24.He also said BJP legislators were not in any way involved in inciting violence when communal riots broke out in Muzaffarnagar Sep 7, leaving 48 dead and over 40,000 homeless.Ramesh said there was hope when Akhilesh Yadav took over as the state chief minister but all those hopes have now been dashed.”Akhilesh is a friend but I have to say that the riots are a big blot on his government and on his very own administrative acumen,” he said. ", "Published_Date": "2013-09-21T23:43:00+05:30"},

He also demanded a probe by the CBI or CB-CID into the matter.\r\rLawyer Shashank Shekhar Tripathi has submitted a letter to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over the demand, stating that the 25-year-old actress was murdered by some people in the hotel room rather than by suicide.\r\r\r\rTripathi, who has taken up the case for the victim&#39;s mother, Madhu Dubey, raised several points in the letter to the chief minister, pointing at suspicion over the death.

Iksanov, however, was offered to work as Medinsky's adviser in the ministry.   The Bolshoi has been shrouded in scandal for years but a fierce conflict erupted in January when an assailant threw acid into the face of Sergei Filin, the artistic director of ballet.   In March, police arrested Bolshoi soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko over his involvement in the attack. Dmitrichenko admitted that he had agreed to an offer from an acquaintance to rough up Filin, but he insisted that the man had used acid on his own initiative. Despite Dmitrichenko's confession, many in the ballet company have stood by him, saying they do not believe him capable of staging such a crime. About 300 dancers and staff, led by principal dancer and Iksanov's key opponent Nikolai Tsiskaridze, signed an open letter claiming that Dmitrichenko had slandered himself under police pressure.   The Bolshoi reopened in 2011 after a $1 billion renovation. Despite the lavish sums, some of the work was of poor quality, with cracks appearing in the walls and gold leaf crumbling away.   Iksanov has been at loggerheads with many of the troupe's famous dancers, including Tsiskaridze who accused him of mismanaging the Bolshoi's reconstruction, ruining its repertoire and abusing dancers' rights. Iksanov and his backers have dismissed the criticism.", "Published_Date": "2013-07-09T14:09:00+05:30"},

There are many questions that no one has been able to answer yet.Here are five mysteries surrounding Gajendra Singh's tragic death:1- Was it an accident or suicide?The biggest question that India is debating is whether the death of Gajendra Singh was a case of suicide, accidental death or a planned political stunt. It is a matter of police investigations but the information available says the 41 year-old farmer was a colourful and emotional man who had no big reasons to commit suicide. Some people are blaming a certain political party saying that the incident could be pre-planned which turned into a disastrous mishap.2- What is the mystery behind the ‘suicide note'?There is a huge mystery behind the suicide note that Gajendra Singh carried. There is nothing in the letter that could suggest that he would take the extreme step. In the note, he mentioned bad crop and that he had been disowned by his father but he did not hint that he would take his own life. Moreover, he talked to his sister just before the incident and said that he will return home by night.3- Financial crunch led to suicide?In the letter, Gajendra mentioned about crop loss but according to the district officials, only 24% of his crop was lost and he never asked for compensation. Visuals of his home suggest that he belonged to a well-off family. Situated on the edge of this Rajput-dominated village, Gajendra's single-storey, pucca house is fairly large. In front of it sprawled the family farmstead. He ran a successful turban business, a gooseberry orchard, and a plantation of teak.4- Was he invited to the rally by AAP leaders?Family of Gajendra Singh claimed that he was close to Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia and the latter had invited him for the rally in the national capital. Jayveer Singh, a relative of deceased farmer, said that Manish Sisodia had called Gajendra several times and asked him to come to Delhi to make the rally a success.5- The farmer was nurturing political ambition?Gajendra Singh had even unsuccessfully contested assembly elections twice on Samajwadi Party ticket. He once was the district chief of Samajwadi Party. He later joined Aam Aadmi Party and was close to several leaders. If he had politically ambitions then why would he take such an extreme step?", "Published_Date": "2015-04-23T14:10:00+05:30"},

The bank's collectors hounded him, even hiring drummers to go round the village drawing attention to his shame.\"My father found it unbearable. He was an honorable man and he couldn't take the humiliation. The next day he hanged himself from a tree on his farm,\" his son Ram Gulam said Friday.Babu's suicide went unreported in local newspapers, just another statistic in a country where more than 15 people kill themselves every hour, according to a new government report.The report released late Thursday said nearly 135,000 people killed themselves in the country of 1.2 billion last year, a 5.9 percent jump in the number of suicides over the past year.The suicide rate increased to 11.4 per 100,000 people in 2010 from 10.9 the year before, according to the statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau.Financial difficulties and debts led to most of the male suicides while women were driven to take their lives because of domestic pressures, including physical and mental abuse and demands for dowry.A 2008 World Health Organization report ranked India 41st for its suicide rate, but because of its huge population it accounted for 20 percent of global suicides.The largest numbers of suicides were reported from the southern Indian states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, where tens of thousands of impoverished farmers have killed themselves after suffering under insurmountable debts.The loans -- from banks and loan sharks -- were often used to buy seeds and farm equipment, or to pay large dowries to get their daughters married. But a bad harvest could plunge the farmer over the edge.Sociologists say the rapid rise in incomes in India's booming economy has resulted in a surge in aspirations as well among the lower and middle classes, and the failure to attain material success can trigger young people to suicide.\"The support that traditionally large Indian families and village communities offered no longer exists in urban situations. Young men and women move to the cities and find they have no one to turn to for succor in times of distress,\" said Abhilasha Kumari, a sociology professor in New Delhi.", "Published_Date": "2011-10-28T16:52:00+05:30"},

{"Article_Url": "https://www.indiatvnews.com/entertainment/hollywood/london-theater-turns-england-039-s-riots-into-a-drama-1289.html", "Title": "London Theater Turns England's Riots Into A Drama", "Author": "India TV News Desk", "Content": "London, Nov 24: It sounds like a tough sell for an evening out: Come relive the London riots.But that is the offer currently packing audiences into London's Tricycle Theatre, a small venue that has built a big reputation with fact-based plays about divisive issues, from Guantanamo Bay to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.“The Riots,” which opened this week, vividly recreates the mayhem that raged for four nights in August through the testimony of real people—residents, police, politicians, community workers and the rioters themselves.Director Nicholas Kent said the play was intended to take the place of a public inquiry into the riots, which the government has declined to hold.“It didn't have to happen,” Kent said. “That's the thing I totally took away from our work on the play.“It seemed to us important to explore the reasons for the riots and people's motivations and what happened and what our response was to it as Londoners—and how we could prevent something like that happening again.”The riots were triggered by the fatal police shooting, in disputed circumstances, of 29-year-old Mark Duggan in the working-class London district of Tottenham on Aug. 4. The play shows how Duggan's death led, partly through accidents and missteps, to Britain's worst civil unrest in a generation. The mayhem across London and other English cities left hundreds of millions of pounds' worth of property damage, as well as pain and questions, in its wake.Writer Gillian Slovo and her researchers taped 56 hours of interviews with everyone from police officers on duty in Tottenham that night to community leaders, young looters and a man left homeless by arson. They even heard from two people imprisoned for rioting, who wrote to the theater with their stories after the Tricycle put an ad in a prison newspaper.The conservative Daily Mail newspaper criticized the company for giving criminals a voice, but Slovo said the rioters' viewpoint was vital.“I do think it's important for us to listen and to see how they got caught up, what they think about it afterwards and what provoked them to do it,” she told BBC radio. “Because otherwise how can you make sure that this won't happen again?”Although a few senior politicians—including London Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May—declined to participate, many agreed to give interviews, as did top police officers. Kent said many police and politicians were as shocked by the riots as most Britons, and wanted to learn the lessons.Kent, who has led the Tricycle since 1984, plans to step down next year. Under his leadership, the 250-seat venue in a scruffy part of north London has gained international acclaim with documentary dramas and verbatim plays which mold real people's words into compelling theater.In 2003, “Justifying War” recreated the legal inquiry into the death of David Kelly, a weapons expert caught up in a storm about the British government's case for war with Iraq. The next year, “Guantanamo—Honor Bound to Defend Freedom” drew on the testimony of terrorist suspects detained at the U.S. naval base in Cuba. The play transferred to London's West End and ran off-Broadway in New York.Although the theater has a left-wing reputation, it has won fans in high places. Earlier this year “The Great Game,” its cycle of short plays covering 200 years of Afghan history, was summoned by The Pentagon for a command performance for senior U.S. defense officials and military brass.London critics were enthusiastic about “The Riots.” The Independent called it a “taut, illuminating two-hour show,” while the generally conservative Daily Telegraph praised it as “thought provoking and admirably evenhanded.”The play is a patchwork that asks more questions than it answers: Was it a race riot? Was it protest or criminality? Were street gangs or government cuts to blame? Could it happen again?There are no comfortable or easy answers, but plenty of striking details that have the ring of truth—and often humor as well.The play conveys how different the experience of the riots felt, depending on vantage point. It captures the distress of victims, the fear of police officers holding the line against a mob, and the excitement of participants caught up in the mayhem.“It looked like Hollywood had come down, set up everything to look like a mad war zone,” says one anonymous rioter, wide-eyed with excitement.Another boasts of his haul from looting: shoes, electronics and a Harry Potter DVD box set. “I don't even like Harry Potter.”The emotional heart of the play is provided by Tottenham resident Mohamed Hammoudan, who fled his apartment with his two young sons after rioters set the store below it ablaze. Compellingly played by Selva Rasalingham, he is reflective and wry, describing the surreal experience of standing amid rioters watching his home burn to the ground.He also gets the last word, when he is asked for three words to sum up the rioters. After a long pause, he replies: “Just angry people.”“The Riots” is at London's Tricycle Theatre until Dec. 10.", "Published_Date": "2011-11-24T22:15:00+05:30"},

And that has its merits but it is not enough.”Tharoor has praised Modi quite a few times recently which was frowned upon by Congress. Last year, he was removed as party spokesperson for his praise of Modi.  He, however, said not much of what Modi has promised has been implemented.“After all, the people who voted for Modi thought they were voting for a man of action. So far instead of a man of action, the nation has got a man of words and the real question that comes is when these words get translated into results,” the former diplomat-turned politician told PTI.  “Consciousness raising is fine and the Prime Minister has raided consciousness on some issues but implementation is essential.The gap between rhetoric and results in Modi's government is wide enough to drive a rath through,” he said.  He also dismissed rumours that he is cosying up to BJP, saying he will remain a Congressman.  Tharoor, who has recently come out with a book “India Shastra: Reflections on the Nation in Our Time”, took strong exception to some saffron leaders' recent comments.  “The party and the political machinery that Modi is riding to get to his goals is a profoundly illiberal. The language used by RSS and saffron leaders is simply divisive and not unifying.“You can't say ‘sabka saath sabka vikas' and then have ministers using outrageous language. You can't have leading lights of the party hailing (Nathuram) Godse and talking about how many children women should bear,” he said.  “Your party is simply promoting a nakedly bigoted Hindutva agenda,” Tharoor said.He also questioned Modi for not taking a tough stand on his ministers for their comments, saying, “Instead of silencing them, Modi himself is silent on the issue.  “This silence of the Prime Minister tantamounts to condoning it and if you condone it you are undermining your own declared objective.”Tharoor said he would have probably delayed publishing his new book, which has two sections devoted to Modi, had the last Lok Sabha election not so overwhelmingly favoured BJP.  “I probably would not have published the book right now because honestly ‘India: From Midnight to the Millennium' was my look at the whole 50 years of India's independence, society, politics, culture, economics; and the ‘The Elephant, the Tiger and the Cellphone' was a 10-year update on the 60th anniversary.“I would probably waited for the 70th or the 80th anniversaries to conclude the trilogy. But when this election result happened, David Davidar (of publisher Aleph) said this is the perfect time for stock-taking—where India has headed and where we have come.”He said so the timing of this book has definitely been prompted by this watershed election and the emergence of the Modi era.Asked whether he would write a book exclusively on the Congress and the UPA government, he said, “What I needed to say has been said in this book.“I don't think I have anything enough to add to make it worthwhile. So to my mind let others who are not as caught up in the internal politics of the country, outside scholars, observers analysts take a look at that.”There is a section in “India Shastra” called ‘The Legacy' which is about the “legacy left” to this government by Congress and UPA.“So there are chapters not only on the earlier legacy from the 40s onwards, Nehruvian legacy, the hijacking of history and Sardar Patel.There is also material on Nehruvian socialism or Nehruvian consensus which has been challenged by the Modi government.“And on the rule and achievements of the UPA government under Manmohan Singh. Plus there is a chapter on steps forward for the Congress party to take as it seeks to revive itself in the new era,” he said. ", "Published_Date": "2015-02-01T16:28:00+05:30"},

Trickle-down theories do not address the legitimate aspirations of the poor. We must lift those at the bottom so that poverty is erased from the dictionary of modern India.”Yechury said, “If there is any sincerity in realising this vision, then the President must direct ‘his government' to legislate the right to food as a fundamental right of all our people.”Quoting UN's Global Hunger Index, he said India ranks 67 amongst the 80 countries in the world which suffer from acute hunger of its people, with 25 per cent of the world's hungry today being Indians. According to this index, India ranks even below countries like North Korea and civil war-ridden and now divided Sudan.The CPI(M) leader's reaction came ahead of the Left parties' plans to organise a five-day protest sit-in outside Parliament from Monday next.“It is precisely to achieve this objective and, thus, banish hunger from our country that the Left parties are pressurising this UPA government through this five-day dharna before Parliament. Such popular mobilisations will have to be strengthened in the future in order to create a better India sans hunger and poverty,” Yechury said.", "Published_Date": "2012-07-26T16:53:00+05:30"},

The platform is certainly a viral trend-setting place where people from many continents could share their talent easily. And this is not a surprise that after a global success and viral video trendsetter, the short format video platform has launched a music streaming app of its own. Also, patent filings have been uncovered by the Insider which further suggests that TikTok has been working on the platform.ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company further filed a trademark application with the Trademark Office for “TikTok Music” in May along with the US Patent. As per the filing, the service would enable the users to purchase, share, play and download music. It would also enable the users to create, share, and recommend the playlists, or comment on music, and as live stream audio and video. ByteDance reportedly filed for a “TikTok Music” trademark in Australia last November 2021.ByteDance further experienced music streaming in 2020, when they launched a music streaming app named ‘Resso’. The app was launched in India, Indonesia and Brazil. The Resso app has very similar features which were described in the “TikTok Music” filing, like the feature of having the ability to create new playlists, interact with the app’s community and share songs on social media.ByteDance has further used the TikTok platform to bring the existing users to Resso. As per The Verge, the TikTok app (Brazil) further comes with a touch button which redirects the users to the Resso app- enabling the user to hear the full version of a song which they have been listening to or are interested in.Although it is unclear if ByteDance is planning on developing a music streaming app which will be based on the Resso framework. Also, there is a lot of speculation if the company will come up with something else entirely. Alike TikTok which had a huge impact on the way social media sites operate, it is possibly the music streaming app which will ties-ins with TikTok and could change the music streaming industry. ", "Published_Date": "2022-08-01T15:43:17+05:30"},

He declared that taxpayers should never again be left “holding the bag” for the mortgage giants' bad bets.The president wants to replace Fannie and Freddie with a system that would put the private sector, not the government, primarily at risk for loans. The government would still be involved, both in oversight and as a last-resort loan guarantor.Obama outlined his proposals in Phoenix, the once foreclosure-riddled desert city at the epicentre of the U.S. housing crisis. The housing market in Phoenix, as well as in many other parts of the country, has rebounded robustly, with prices in the south-western city up 66 percent from the low point in 2011.Despite the nationwide gains, the president said sweeping housing reforms are still needed to ensure that a rejuvenated market doesn't simply “re-inflate the housing bubble.” The cornerstone of that effort is winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a proposal with bipartisan support in the Senate.“For too long, these companies were allowed to make big profits buying mortgages, knowing that if their bets went bad, taxpayers would be left holding the bag,” Obama told a crowd of more than 2,000 at an area high school. He spoke following a tour of a construction company that has been able to hire hundreds of new workers as a result of the region's housing comeback.While the president has previously endorsed overhauling Fannie and Freddie, his remarks Tuesday marked the first time he outlined his specific priorities for doing so.Obama is also seeking guarantees that a private sector-led mortgage finance system would still ensure wide homeowner access to popular 30-year mortgages at fixed rates.Making light of criticism from Republicans who have cast him as a big-spending liberal, Mr. Obama joked that his calls for deeper private sector involvement “must sound confusing to the folks who call me a socialist.”Once flourishing, Fannie and Freddie were bailed out in 2008 by a $187 billion taxpayer-backed bailout. The two enterprises don't make loans directly, but buy mortgages from lenders, package them as bonds, guarantee them against default and sell them to investors. The enterprises currently own or guarantee half of all U.S. mortgages and back nearly 90 percent of new ones.Mr. Obama's trip to Phoenix marked the latest stop on a summertime tour aimed at rallying the public around his economic policies ahead of looming budget fights with congressional Republicans this fall. It was also a return to the city he visited just weeks after taking office in 2009 to tout the government's role in bolstering the housing market.The nationwide housing recovery has been providing critical support to the economy at a time when manufacturing and business investment have stagnated. Steady job growth and low mortgage rates in the past year have also fuelled more home sales. The increased demand, along with a tight supply of homes for sale, has pushed home prices higher and encouraged builders to start more homes and create more construction jobs.", "Published_Date": "2013-08-07T09:12:00+05:30"},

Uncovering it gives \"us all a chance to look at this and _ even as we are appalled at what was done _ to redouble our efforts to make sure something like this could never happen again,\" said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health.  The NIH-funded experiment, which ran from 1946 to 1948, was uncovered by a Wellesley College medical historian. It apparently was conducted to test if penicillin, then relatively new, could prevent some sexually transmitted infections. The study came up with no useful information and was hidden for decades.  \"We are outraged that such reprehensible research could have occurred under the guise of public health,\" Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said Friday. President Barack Obama called Guatemala's president, Alvaro Colom, later Friday to apologize. Clinton had called to apologize the night before.  \"Obviously this is shocking, it's tragic, it's reprehensible,\" said White House press secretary Robert Gibbs. \"It's tragic and the U.S. by all means apologizes to all those who were impacted.\" Guatemalan Embassy official Fernando de la Cerda said his country hadn't known anything about the experiment until Clinton called to apologize Thursday night.  \"We appreciate this gesture from the USA, acknowledging the mistake and apologizing,\" he said. \"This must not affect the bilateral relationship.\"  Strict regulations today make clear that it is unethical to experiment on people without their consent, and require special steps for any work with such vulnerable populations as prisoners. But such regulations didn't exist in the 1940s.  The U.S. government ordered two independent investigations to uncover exactly what happened in Guatemala and to make sure current bioethics rules are adequate. They will be led by the prestigious Institute of Medicine and the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. Wellesley College historian Susan Reverby made the discovery while combing the archived records of Dr. John Cutler, a government researcher involved in the Tuskegee study that from 1932 to 1972 tracked 600 black men in Alabama who had syphilis without ever offering them treatment.  She discovered that Cutler also led the Guatemala project that went a step further: A total of 696 men and women were exposed to syphilis or in some cases gonorrhea _ through jail visits by prostitutes or, when that didn't infect enough people, by deliberately inoculating them. They were offered penicillin, but it wasn't clear how many were infected and how many were successfully treated.  She reported that the U.S. had gained permission from Guatemalan officials to conduct the study, but did not inform the experimental subjects.  While secretly trying to infect people with serious diseases is abhorrent today, the Guatemalan experiment isn't the only example from what Collins on Friday called \"a dark chapter in the history of medicine.\" Forty similar deliberate-infection studies were conducted in the United States during that period, Collins said.  \"We've made some obvious moral progress\" in protecting the poor and powerless, said Dr. Arthur Caplan, a University of Pennsylvania bioethicist. \"The sad legacy\" of past unethical experiments is that \"they still shape who it is that we can get to trust medical researchers.\"  A continuing ethical dilemma in developing countries is what Caplan calls the \"left-behind syndrome,\" when the people who helped test a treatment can never afford the resulting care. \"It's still ethically contentious as to how we ought to conduct, or whether we ought to conduct, certain forms of research in poor nations today,\" he said.  Reverby, whose work was first reported by NBC News, made the discovery last year and gave a speech about it at a medical historians' meeting in May, which a U.S. health official heard. She provided her findings to the government the next month, resulting in Friday's apology, and has posted them on her website.  The revelation of abuses by a U.S. medical research program is only the latest chapter in the United States' troubled history with the impoverished Central American nation, which has a per capita gross domestic product about half of that of the rest of Central America and the Caribbean.  The U.S. helped topple the democratically elected president Jacobo Arbenz in 1954 and backed several hardline governments during a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996 and cost 200,000 lives.

Since then her death has been in the headlines with some or the other twist coming in the way of investigation.So far, Pratyusha’s live-in boyfriend Rahul Raj Singh has been the prime suspect.On the other hand, Rahul has come forward in his defence and has filed legal suit against Kamya Punjabi, a close friend of Pratyusha who has been quite vocal against Singh since the beginning.Rahul has alleged that it was Kamya who borrowed Rs. 2.5 lakhs from the late actress.While everyone was surprised at this revelation, Kamya Punjabi lashed out Rahul for having inappropriate facts and creating confusion in the case.She also clarified the mystery of Rs. 2.5 lakhs that Pratyusha gave her.“BCL ka playoff season aaya tha TV par. I am the owner of Jaipur Raj Joshilay team in the cricket tournament. Pratyusha, being my friend, was the brand ambassador of the team. She wanted that her dad’s NGO be promoted through our team since there was media involved. She had given me Rs2.5 lakh as the sponsorship amount. We had made standees and we did many media interviews during that time. Borrowing Rs2.5 lakh is different and sponsoring a team are two different things. I have proof to show that it was sponsorship money. Aaj tak aisi naubat nahin aayi hai ki udhaar maangna pade. This happened around three years ago when Rahul wasn’t even in Pratyusha’s life. Tell him to get his facts right. Jaipur Raj Joshilay is my team and I have bank accounts of the team. Jo humne standees banwaye thay woh bhi humne NGO ko waapis kar diye thay,” Kamya told a leading daily.Looks like Rahul’s trick to defend himself just backfired. Let’s see what more is to be unveiled in the mysterious suicide case of Pratyusha Banerjee. ", "Published_Date": "2016-05-09T13:18:05+05:30"},

We are taking every precaution to maintain confidentiality of what is important.“At the same time, we are also stepping up defence preparedness and you can be sure we are prepared at all times.” The pilots of the chopper, flying from Leh to Bhimbhat in Jammu and Kashmir on a routine sortie on Sunday, went across the Line of Control at around 1320 hours following bad weather.Soon after the landing, the pilots and two other personnel of the Indian Army realised that the helipad was not in the Indian territory but in Pak-controlled Northern Areas.Once on the ground, they were surrounded by the Pakistani army and escorted to the nearby building, they said.

According to the new rules, foreign universities can now set up campuses inside India. They can also decide upon their admission process, fee structure and even repatriate funds back to their parent universities situated abroad.This move will likely help students in accessing quality higher education and also serve as much-needed competition to the Indian public and private universities. Eventually, the Indian higher education landscape will be able to attain global-level standards. Successive governments from 1995 have tried to enact legislation for the entry, operation, and regulation of foreign universities in the country. The most recent of these attempts were made by the UPA-II government in 2010, which, however, was then opposed by parties including BJP (in the Opposition at that time) and the left parties.One of the main issues in the bill was that it would raise the cost of education in the country due to high fees and faculty poaching from public universities. It was not also clear if it would generate adequate interest from the best universities abroad to set up campuses in India.According to official data, over 4.5 lakh Indian students went to study abroad in 2022 leading to an estimated outflow of USD 28-30 billion. However, Kumar pointed out that the living costs of students will be minimized as they will be able to access global quality education inside the country itself. This will bring down overall educational expenses.The latest UGC draft also seeks to incentivize the setting up of campuses in India by allowing full autonomy to foreign higher education institutions, especially the ability to repatriate funds back to parent universities. Govt officials said that the enormous target segment of 18-23 individuals, of whom only a quarter are enrolled in higher education institutions, will also serve as a motivator for foreign institutions to set up campuses in India.Although, it remains to be seen if the extensive financial and operational autonomy will be enough to attract globally well-respected academic institutions.Also Read | 'Foreign University will need UGC's approval to set up campuses in India' says ChairmanAlso Read | UGC Chairman reveals framework for India’s First National Digital University", "Published_Date": "2023-01-06T17:54:06+05:30"},

The power men were up in arms against the state government soon after it started the procedure to appoint consultants to advice it on the road map to private power in four cities - Meerut, Varanasi, Kanpur city and Ghaziabad. The state government clarified that it would now not press on with privatisation of the power sector.While the Akhilesh Yadav government had taken a tough stance on the matter earlier, declaring the strike call illegal, it was forced to cave in under relentless pressure.State Principal Secretary (energy) and Chairman of UPPCL Sanjay Agarwal called a meeting late Tuesday night of power corporation officials and protesting power sector workers. Around midnight, the issue was resolved after Sanjay Agarwal offered a written undertaking that the sector would not be privatised. The workers then withdrew the strike call.

Among the key issues holding Expression of Interest (EoI), first stage of bidding, is whether FDI norms have to be relaxed to allow foreign airlines to take full control of the airline and extending national carrier status after change in ownership.While raising FDI limit in domestic airlines beyond 49 per cent for foreign carriers would enthuse carriers like Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines to participate in the bidding, national carrier status would give right of first refusal to the new owner in seat allocation on international routes.The other issues include transfer of additional debt to the special purpose vehicle (SPV) and use of brand name Air India in future. As much as Rs 10,000 crore of additional debt, over and above Rs 29,464 crore decided earlier, is proposed to be moved to Air India Assets Holdings Ltd (AIAHL), the special purpose vehicle of Air India for transferring part of its debt and assets.\"Even after transfer of Rs 29,464 crore of debt to SPV, the same amount of debt would still be there. It has to be decided by the group of secretaries and then the ministerial panel as to how much more debt has to be taken out to ensure sale process happens,\" an official said.\"The amount of debt will be related to the assets that would be on the airline books,\" he added.A core group of secretaries met on Thursday to consider pending issues and resolve them so that the bidding process for Air India could begin by November-end. This will be the second attempt of the Modi government to sell Air India. In the first attempt last year, it had failed to attract a single buyer forcing it to abandon the sale process.Among many issues, private investors were concerned about government retaining 24 per cent stake in the airline. The government has hence decided this time to almost completely exit Air India.\"The government has to also see this time how many employees would the new buyer be comfortable in taking. There are some other issues too and based on how early they are resolved the EoI would be invited,\" the official said.ALSO READ| Air India seeks $819 million loan for 7 Boeing planesALSO READ| Government likely to float bids for Air India sale next month", "Published_Date": "2019-11-01T13:54:05+05:30"},

SEBI's in-house study analysed 45 IPOs that hit the market during last two fiscals.Their performance was analysed against the backdrop of various primary market reforms undertaken by SEBI during 2012-13.Out of these 45 IPOs, four were withdrawn and four others were of large size with applications received from more than two lakh investors.Several measures such as minimum allotment to retail investors, electronic bidding for IPO shares, extending the reach of ASBA (Application Supported by Blocked Amount), were implemented by SEBI in 2012-13 to revive the subdued primary market and boost the investor confidence.The analysis of all these 45 issues found that the average number of retail investors applying for shares rose to 1,16,907 per issue in the post-reform period (October 1, 2012- March 31, 2013), from an average of 37,626 in the pre-reform period (April 1, 2011-September 30, 2012).After excluding the withdrawn IPOs and large issues, the analysis of remaining 37 issues showed that the average number of retail investors per issue rose from 6,486 to 64,595. The average subscription by retail investors also rose from Rs 70.70 crore to Rs 190.3 crore in this category.The analysis of the four large IPOs showed that the average number of retail investors in these issues rose from 2.58 lakh to 3.26 lakh per issue.Among various reforms, SEBI has introduced an e-IPO mechanism through which investments can be done online without signing any physical documents. This has helped fast-track the public offer processing time.On account of streamlining of process and other external factors, the average time taken for processing offer documents has also come down from 152 days to 48 days, SEBI said.“The facility to procure IPO form and submit it, is now available to investors in more than 1,000 locations on account of SEBI circular on use of stock broker network of stock exchanges for submitting applications in public issuances,” the market regulator said.It further said: “The investors are now directly able to submit ASBA applications in more than 67,000 bank branches as against less than 10,000 branches that existed before...”", "Published_Date": "2013-09-29T15:36:00+05:30"},

Besides, plans are on the anvil for selling the headquarter building of Air India in the national capital as well as various other land assets and buildings of the airline in different parts of the country.The government has prepared a list of the airline's assets that could be hived off as part of the strategic sale plan for Air India and its subsidiaries, officials said.According to them, the disinvestment process is likely to be initiated soon for four Air India subsidiaries -- AASL, HCI, Air India Air Transport Service Ltd (AIATSL) and Air India Engineering Service Ltd (AIESL).While AASL, under the name Alliance Air, provides regional air connectivity, HCI owns and operates two hotels in Delhi and Srinagar, among others.AIATSL provides ground handling and cargo handling services. AIESL is mainly into maintenance, repair and overhaul of engines.Apart from the headquarters building, other assets proposed to be sold include Air India properties in Mumbai and Delhi.Officials said the government also plans to sell various art works and artefacts.In June, a ministerial panel chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley deferred the strategic sale of the government's 76 per cent stake in Air India. Instead, it was decided that the government would look at sale of assets and subsidiaries of the national carrier to reduce the debt burden.Air India, which has been in the red for long, had a debt burden of Rs 48,000 crore at the end of March 2017.The government had originally proposed to offload 76 per cent equity share capital of the national carrier as well as transfer the management control to private players. However, the offer failed to attract any bidder when the deadline for initial bids closed on May 31.The national airline is staying afloat on a bailout package extended by the previous UPA regime in 2012 and the government is also looking at ways to infuse more funds into the carrier.For the current fiscal, the government expects to raise Rs 80,000 crore from strategic as well as minority stake sales in public sector enterprises.So far this fiscal, the government has raised over Rs 9,220 crore by divesting stakes in state-owned companies.Last year, the government had mopped up over Rs 1.03 lakh crore from PSU disinvestment.This was aided by country's oldest gas producer ONGC's Rs 36,915 crore acquisition of government-owned fuel retailer Hindustan Petroleum.", "Published_Date": "2018-09-16T12:22:21+05:30"},

Between Indian Airlines and Air India there are many (salary) grades. If it doesn't integrate well, then it becomes a nightmare”, IATA chief Giovanni Bisignani told PTI here.  To questions on the acute problems faced by the Indian national carrier, he expressed “disappointment” over the crucial pending issues relating to the merger of the two former state-run airlines and said “there has to be a political consensus because it has to happen fast”.  The merger, including integration of employees, “is something to be handled in a very effective manner. Put an administrator with full powers. It has taken too much time.  “The administrator should take full responsibility to take tough decisions. But the decision has to be a political decision. Therefore, the (administrator's) decisions need political support”, the Director General and CEO of global airlines' body International Air Transport Association said.  “Give, say, six months time to it (administrator to take decisions). But before giving any time-frame, make the airline smaller and efficient”, Bisignani said.  “I am not giving any advise. But this limbo situation cannot be allowed to continue for long. It is a problem for the passenger, the airline as well as the government as it continues to burn the national budget. It also creates problems for safety”, he said. Observing that it was “much more easier to restructure when the aviation market is growing” in India, Bisignani said it was important for India to “have a big national carrier.  The country has to give its national carrier a chance to play a role.”The IATA chief gave examples of good and bad mergers in the airline industry, saying there was “a great history of failures also.”Referring to the 2001-02 merger of Japan Airlines (JAL) and Japan Air Systems (JAS), he said the two airlines later sought government protection due to near bankruptcy situation.  But these airlines were small in size, and therefore the problems were less than those of Air India, he said.  To questions on the growth in the aviation sector in India, the IATA chief said the growth in infrastructure was slow but picking up. “It has been slow, but much faster than in Europe or the US” as those markets grew over time while the growth in India was very fast.While India was the sixth largest market in numerical terms, the Chinese market was 220 million in absolute terms.  “It is almost four times than India. Indian market is big and has tripled in five years but still small in numbers”.  He also said that India had “more problems than in China where you take a decision and implement it”.  While the Indian market has tripled over the past five years, the markets in China and Brazil had doubled during this period.On the domestic front, India and Brazil showed the strongest domestic growth of 25.6 and 23.8 per cent respectively, Bisignani quoted IATA figures as saying.

So, we would explore the possibility of FPO or QIP next fiscal after due consultation with the government,” he said.For raising the Tier I capital of the bank, the government has agreed to infuse capital to the tune of Rs 7,900 crore by March 31, 2012.Post capital infusion, the government holding in the bank would rise to 62 per cent, from about 59 per cent at present.As per the existing regulation the government holding cannot come down below 51 per cent.So there is headroom for stake dilution of about 11 per cent in the bank, he said, if the government permits, the bank may go in for raising capital.Terming 0.75 percentage cut in Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) a week ahead of the mid-quarterly review of monetary policy on March 15 as a “surprise,” he said this would help easing liquidity pressure on the system.“I don't think that RBI would take further action the policy review (on March 15),” he said.The apex bank slashed CRR, the percentage of deposits that banks have to keep with the RBI, from 5.5 per cent to 4.75 per cent on March 9. With this, the central bank infused Rs 48,000 crore into the economy.On the issue of fresh lending to Kingfisher Airlines, he said, “there is need for fresh capital. I think the management of the airline is alive to the issue and would make all effort to get fresh capital.”Asked if SBI participated in the recent ONGC share sale, Chaudhuri said the bank did participate in the Offer for Sale.He, however, refused to divulge details of share purchase made by the bank.Of the 42.04 crore shares auctioned earlier this month, state-owned insurance giant LIC picked up 37.71 crore shares in ONGC.", "Published_Date": "2012-03-11T20:30:00+05:30"},

A US intelligence assessment described shows that Said Kouachi was trained in preparation to return home and carry out an attack.If confirmed, the attack would be the first time al-Qaida's branch in Yemen has successfully carried out an operation in the West after at least two earlier attempts.\"The leadership of AQAP directed the operations and they have chosen their target carefully as revenge for the honour of the prophet,\" the al-Qaida member said in an English statement. He said France was targeted \"because of its obvious role in the war on Islam and oppressed nations.\"He warned that \"touching Muslims' sanctity and protecting those who make blasphemy have a dear price and the punishment will be severe\" and that \"the crimes of the Western countries, above them America, Britain and France will backfire deep in their home.\"He said the group will continue the policy by al-Qaida chief Ayman al-Zawahri of \"hitting the snake's head ... until the West retreats.\" He also cited the late al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden's warnings of the consequences of blasphemy against Muslim sanctities.The member provided the statement on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized by the group to give his name. The same statement in Arabic was later posted on Twitter by users known to be supporters of AQAP. The member said the group has delayed its official declaration of responsibility for \"security reasons.\"Witnesses to Wednesday's assault in Paris said Said Kouachi, the elder of the two brothers who stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices, claimed allegiance to the Yemeni group during the attack. His 32-year-old brother, Cherif Kouachi, was convicted of terrorism charges in 2008 for ties to a network sending jihadis to fight US forces in Iraq. The brothers were killed on Friday in a gunbattle with French police.A Yemeni security official said Said Kouachi is believed to have fought with al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula in 2011 in Abyan province.At the time, al-Qaida fighters had taken advantage of a security vacuum during an uprising that eventually ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The militants seized several towns and cities in the south of the country. Abyan province was an al-Qaida stronghold from which the group launched attacks against government forces and new offensives to seize more territory.The second Yemeni official said Kouachi was believed to be among hundreds of foreigners deported in 2012, when the government expelled many foreign students, fearing they were there under the pretext of studying Arabic but were in fact linking up with al-Qaida.Both officials, on condition of anonymity, said because of an ongoing investigation into Kouachi's stay in Yemen.US officials believe French authorities knew Kouachi traveled to Yemen, but it's not clear whether they knew what he did there. Still, French authorities placed both Kouachi brothers close surveillance when he returned. The officials believe the brothers led a normal life for long enough that the French began to view them as less of a threat and reduced the surveillance.A US law enforcement official said both Kouachi brothers had raised enough concern to be placed on the no-fly list. He spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation.Previously, al-Qaida's Yemen branch directed the December 2009 attempt to bomb an American passenger jet over Detroit. The would-be bomber, Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who failed the detonate explosives on his body, went to Yemen to prepare for the attack and may have met with radical American-Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, linked to al-Qaida. Al-Awlaki was killed in a US drone strike in September 2011.In 2010, the group attempted to send bombs in packages to be delivered to targets in the United States, but the packages were intercepted on flights through Europe and the United Arab Emirates.", "Published_Date": "2015-01-10T08:38:00+05:30"},

They do reduce re-offending in the men.\"But they also have side effects, such as osteoporosis, changes in cardiovascular health, blood fat levels, blood pressure and symptoms that mimic women's menopause.The process of chemical castration has been used in various forms in several countries including Argentina, Australia, Estonia, Israel, Moldova, New Zealand, Poland and Russia, according to CNN.The practice of forced chemical castration has been called \"inhuman treatment\" by Amnesty International.", "Published_Date": "2015-09-05T17:28:23+05:30"},

It also will apply to defaulters who have an outstanding of Rs 100 crore or more and have escaped from the country. As part of drive to clean the banking system, the Finance Ministry last week had directed public sector banks (PSBs) to probe all NPA accounts of over Rs 50 crore for possible fraud and accordingly report the cases to CBI. \"PSB MDs directed to detect bank frauds &amp; consequential wilful default in time &amp; refer cases to CBI.

The PR official statement also explains the display being developed in partnership with the supplier.\r\r&quot;Xiaomi&rsquo;s Global PR Team official statement: The double folding smartphone is the latest innovation by Xiaomi. One of the key components of the phone, the flexible folding screen, is co-developed by Xiaomi and its supply chain partner. Aside from the screen, its design, folding mechanism and MIUI adaptation are independently developed by us.\r\rXiaomi is first in the world to present a double folding smartphone and has conquered the technical challenges posed in its three different form factors &ndash; double folded, single folded, and tablet form. Prior to finding the best solution, Xiaomi has conducted extensive research and experiments to develop a robust folding mechanism that will allow the flexible screen to withstand mechanical stress.\r\rEach innovation is the result of joint, cumulative R&amp;D efforts from supply chain partners and the device manufacturer. It is misguided to think a folding screen can be easily turned into a folding smartphone without significant breakthroughs in technology. Each segment of the industrial chain has its unique contribution. Xiaomi believes that innovative products and great user experience are made possible with sound collaboration and participation from all parties.&quot;\r\r\r\rOther than this LetsGoDigital has gone and published some 3D renders of the foldable device based on the previous leaks that show the MIUI skin that the company will use in the foldable device.

We are looking at a 30 percent growth by this fiscal-end,\" bank's managing director and chief executive Chandra Shekhar Ghosh said.Having started banking operation in August last year, the focus has been on liabilities side. It has garnered over Rs 11,000 crore in deposits so far. Of this, around 21 percent comprises low cost savings and current account deposits.Most of the term deposits are of one to three year tenure.\"We also looking at 30 percent growth of deposits by end of next March,\" said Ghosh, who rose to the present position after working in his father's small sweet shop in Agartala, before starting the micro-finance company in 2000.He said the bank had got good responses so far from the depositors and almost 33 percent of the funds had come from retail depositors.\"Our focus will remain on the doorstep services, as also on building relations with depositors and customers, as a strategy to garner more deposits and increase business volume,\" the bank's founder said how the targets will be pursued.The bank, with a capital base of Rs 3,200 crore and a healthy capital adequacy ratio of nearly 40 percent, has extended its branch network to 656 across 27 states. It plans to further increase it to around 750 by March end, 2017, he said.On lending, the bank's total advances stood at Rs 15,000 crore. New lending channels like home loans, car and two wheeler loans, small and medium business loans have also been opened.\"In terms of lending to new channels, we plan to focus and operate in a segment where borrowers normally do not get funding from other banks. Since there is more risk involved in this segment, we are taking more time in scaling up our lending programme in new channels,\" Ghosh said.At the beginning of the banking operation, the Kolkata-based private lender had Rs 8,500 crore of high-cost loans on its book, borrowed from other banks for microfinance operations. \"We've repaid Rs 5,000 crore and will repay rest of the high-cost loans within next one year.\"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had given a special permission to the bank to carry its high-cost loans on its book. Before becoming a bank, as microfinance institution, Bandhan used to borrow from banks at an average 12-14 percent rates.Since the West Bengal-headquartered lender is able to access public deposits, the cost of funds seems to have come down. This, in turn, is likely to translate into its lending rates. Bandhan Bank's base rate is now at 12 percent, which is relatively higher than other banks.\"We will likely take a decision in this month (April) on our base rate, to see whether we can reduce it or not,\" he said. The central bank's monetary policy for this fiscal, in which the short-term lending rate has been cut, should help Bandhan in this regard.\"The base rate of a bank depends on the operating cost and cost of procuring funds. Our operating cost as a new bank is relatively higher than other banks. The risk premium in segments we operate in is also high. All of that reflects in our base rate,\" Ghosh said.\"But we will definitely review our base rate.\"", "Published_Date": "2016-04-06T10:38:30+05:30"},

The weekly newspaper had been repeatedly threatened—and its offices were firebombed in 2011 -- after spoofing Islam and depicting the Prophet Muhammad in caricature.Heavily armed security forces with air cover moved along country roads and among old stone buildings. The country's maximum terror alert was extended from Paris to the northern Picardie region, focusing on towns that might be safe havens for Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34.Prime Minister Manuel Valls said both men were known to intelligence services.A senior U.S. official said Thursday the elder Kouachi had traveled to Yemen, although it was unclear whether he was there to join extremist groups like al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, which is based there.The younger brother, Cherif, was convicted of terrorism charges in 2008 for his links to a network sending jihadis to fight American forces in Iraq.Both were also on the U.S. no-fly list, a senior U.S. counterterrorism official said. The American officials also spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss foreign intelligence publicly.French President Francois Hollande called for tolerance after the country's worst terrorist attack in decades.“France has been struck directly in the heart of its capital, in a place where the spirit of liberty—and thus of resistance—breathed freely,” Hollande said.Nine people, members of the brothers' entourage, have been detained for questioning in several regions.In all, 90 people, many of them witnesses to the grisly assault on the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo, were questioned for information on the attackers, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said in a statement.The minister confirmed reports the men were identified by the elder brother's ID card, left in an abandoned getaway car, a slip that contrasted with the seeming professionalism of the attack.A third suspect, 18-year-old Mourad Hamyd, surrendered at a police station Wednesday evening after hearing his name linked to the attacks. His relationship to the Kouachi brothers was unclear.The Kouachi brothers—born in Paris to Algerian parents—were well-known to French counterterrorism authorities. Cherif Kouachi, a former pizza deliveryman, had appeared in a 2005 French TV documentary on Islamic extremism and was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 for trying to join up with fighters battling in Iraq.Charlie Hebdo had long drawn threats for its depictions of Islam, although it also satirized other religions and political figures. The weekly paper had caricatured the Prophet Muhammad, and a sketch of Islamic State's leader was the last tweet sent out by the irreverent newspaper, minutes before the attack. Nothing has been tweeted since.Eight journalists, two police officers, a maintenance worker and a visitor were killed in the attack.Charlie Hebdo planned a special edition next week, produced in the offices of another paper.Editor Stephane Charbonnier, known as Charb, who was among those slain, “symbolized secularism ... the combat against fundamentalism,” his companion, Jeannette Bougrab, said on BFM-TV.“He was ready to die for his ideas,” she said.Authorities around Europe have warned of the threat posed by the return of Western jihadis trained in warfare. France counts at least 1,200 citizens in the war zone in Syria—headed there, returned or dead.Both the Islamic State group and al-Qaida have threatened France—home to Western Europe's largest Muslim population.The French suspect in a deadly 2014 attack on a Jewish museum in Belgium had returned from fighting with extremists in Syria; and the man who rampaged in southern France in 2012, killing three soldiers and four people at a Jewish school, received paramilitary training in Pakistan. ", "Published_Date": "2015-01-09T14:34:00+05:30"},

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech said that to bring the prices of precious metals closer to previous levels, the government will rationalise customs duty on gold and silver.\r\rGold and silver presently attract a basic customs duty of 12.5 per cent. Since the duty was raised from 10 per cent in July 2019, prices of precious metals have risen sharply. But the government in the Budget cut the customs duty on gold and silver to 7.5 per cent while duties on other precious metals were cut down to 6.9 per cent on gold dore bar from 11.85 per cent; 6.1 per cent on silver dore bar from 11 per cent; 10 per cent on platinum from 12.5 per cent; 10 per cent for gold/silver findings from 20 per cent; and 10 per cent on precious metal coins from 12.5 per cent.\r\rBUDGET 2021 FULL COVERAGE\r\rAll these sectors, however, would also attract &#39;Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess&#39; at the rate of 2.5 per cent.\r\rWelcoming the decision, Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) Chairman Colin Shah said that it would help in promoting domestic manufacturing and boosting exports. &quot;It was our long pending demand to cut the import duty on gold and silver. It is a welcome move for the domestic organised sector,&quot; he said.\r\rVastupal Ranka of Gem &amp; Jewellery Trade Council of India said that the Budget 2021 is favourable for the industry and the industry players are happy that not extra duties or taxes are levied.\r\r&quot;The budget proves good for exporters as prices in the international markets come down making India more competitive in the global market. As expected, the customs duty on gold and silver have been reduced by 2.5% - from 10% to 7.5%. Gold Dore bars and Silver Dore bars will respectively attract customs duty of 6.9% and 6.1%, compared to the existing rates as well. These three items will also attract Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess at the rate of 2.5 per cent. All these provisions are encouraging and highly beneficial to the sector as it boosts growth, investment and capital,&quot; Ranka said.\r\rREAD MORE:&nbsp;Capital base of small companies raised from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 2 crore\r\rSaurabh Khandelwal, Owner of Dhanvi Diamond, said that custom duty revision has already seen the effect in the afternoon session on the day of Budget. He said that more effects on the prices of gold will be visible in the coming days.\r\r&quot;This spurs the demand for gold in the market. NRIs who buy gold outside India will also find Indian gold industry attractive and begin to buy more in the coming times with this budget. We definitely expect a boost in sales as the domestic market will improve and, people will be more motivated to invest in gold and purchase gold for festivals and occasions,&quot; Saurabh said.\r\rIndia is the largest importer of gold, which mainly caters to demand of the jewellery industry. In volume terms, the country imports 800-900 tonnes of gold annually. Gems and jewellery exports declined by about 40 per cent to about USD 17 billion during the nine months of the current fiscal.\r\rREAD MORE:&nbsp;What is Bad Bank?

The RBI said there was a need for an effective reduction in the non-performing assets (NPAs) and improvements in the loan recovery process. According to the RBI, there is also a need to “stimulate and foster competition in the banking sector and liberalise licensing policies”. The RBI said growth of the Indian banking sector slowed down for the second consecutive year in 2012-13 amid slowdown in the domestic economy and tepid global recovery.

In August, the government announced a mega plan to merge 10 public sector banks into four with a view to creating fewer and stronger global-sized lenders with robust balance sheets that can be used to boost credit and spur growth.\r\rDuring the Question Hour, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur said lending and other banking services to eastern states will be improved after two Kolkata-based banks are merged. While United Bank of India (UBI) will be merged with Punjab National Bank, Allahabad Bank will be amalgamated with Indian Bank. These two banks are headquartered in Kolkata.\r\r&quot;Merger of banks will strengthen the lending capacity. It has been ensured that no person loses a job. The employees of merging banks will benefit the maximum. The merger is being done keeping their interest in mind,&quot; he said. &quot;We have taken enough precaution,&quot; he said, adding that Narasimham Committee in 1998 and Leeladhar Committee in 2008 recommended amalgamation of the banks.\r\r&quot;Amalgamating banks were advised to duly factor in and draw road maps for converging IT systems and HR and to put in place institutional arrangements to ensure expeditious integration,&quot; Thakur said.\r\rAfter due consideration by their respective boards, the banks have informed that multi-level coordination and integration committees have been set up to ensure faster integration across functionalities, he added. The minister was responding to a query from Trinamool Congress member Manish Gupta who said that about 50,000 employees will be jobless by next year due to the merger.\r\rTo another query on banking services likely to be affected in eastern states due to the merger, the minister said the reach and lending capacity will be &quot;much larger and better&quot; with the amalgamation.\r\r&quot;In today&#39;s time of competition, I think the expansion of these banks is very important...It was our government which went for asset quality review of bank loans given between 2004 and 2014. We adopted an approach for better functioning of the banks and recapitalised them with over Rs 2.35 lakh crore for better strengthening and functioning,&quot; he said. As far as lending to eastern states is concerned, the minister said, &quot;Let me assure the member there would not be any shortage or shortfall of services.&quot;\r\rResponding to another query from Trinamool Congress member Manas Ranjan Bhunia on reasons for merger of UBI with PNB, the minister said, &quot;I think the overall intention was to create a strong and competitive bank that may serve as a catalyst of growth with the improved risk profile of the bank. As far as the interest of the employees is concerned, pay allowances were less favourable overall.&quot;\r\rHe said UBI&#39;s total business size is Rs 2,08,000 crore, whereas that of PNB is Rs 11,82,224 crore. With the merger, the total business size will be Rs 17,94,526 crore, making it the second-largest bank in the country.\r\r&quot;What we have kept in mind is the software &#39;Core Banking System&#39; being used by them. All these banks which are using similar kind of software have been merged accordingly so that there would not be any difficulty for the employees,&quot; he said. As far as the sentiment of eastern states or Kolkata is concerned, that will be taken care of, Thakur added.\r\rALSO READ |&nbsp;Maruti cars to be costlier from January 2020.\r\rALSO READ |&nbsp;Top 5 smartphones launching in December 2019\r", "Published_Date": "2019-12-03T17:24:18+05:30"},

The complaints can be filed on the BISCARE APP or consumer engagement portal of the Union consumer affairs ministry, it said.\r\rSo far, gold hallmarking in the country was voluntary in nature. But, in 2019, the government announced it would make it mandatory from January 15, 2021, but the deadline was extended twice till June 15 after the jewellers sought more time in view of the pandemic.\r\rMove to protect interest of consumers: BIS\r\rBureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Director-General Pramod Kumar Tiwari said it is a major move to protect the interest of consumers.\r\rTo ensure jewellers adapt to the new system, the government has decided not to impose a penalty on jewellers for only three months till August for non-compliance of the mandatory gold hallmarking norms, he added.\r\r&quot;This is a massive change that is happening in the ecosystem of the industry. There are lakhs of jewellers, including small jewellers, who have to register themselves and get accustomed to the new system. It takes time,&quot; Tiwari said.\r\rThe reason is that the government in three months will concentrate on handholding jewellers, helping customers and manufacturers to adapt to the new system, he said.\r\r&quot;It does not mean, if there are any complaints, i.e. someone is indulging in serious kind of malpractice, and no action will be taken. That is not the point,&quot; Tiwari said adding that after three months, a penalty will be imposed.\r\rThe BIS DG further said jewellers had apprehension that they would be punished if they were found to have committed &quot;small mistake like in sending jewellery to assaying centres or delay in registering themselves for hallmarking&quot;.\r\r&quot;We have tried to allay these apprehensions. We have told jewellers not to be scared of the new system. Make best efforts to adopt,&quot; he said.\r\rMandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery in phased manner\r\rInitially, the government was to implement the mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery and related items in the entire country. But, after an overnight meeting with stakeholders, it decided to roll out in a phased manner and also relaxed this norm for certain players in the industry.\r\rAsked the reason for the phased-wise approach, Tiwari said the government had been discussing with stakeholders and there was this &quot;dilemma whether to do it in the entire country or in a phased manner&quot;.\r\r&quot;It is a conscious, balanced and positive decision that we have taken, taking into the interest of everybody. It is good for the country. We are making a beginning,&quot; he said.\r\rIt is a historical day and the government is quite sure that once the first phase is implemented successfully, the awareness among consumers will increase, he added.\r\rOut of 715-odd districts in the country, mandatory hallmarking of gold jewellery and artefacts has come into force in 256 districts across the country for 14, 18 and 22 carats of gold jewellery/artefacts only from Wednesday.\r\rRest of districts will be included in two phases. In the second phase, another 240-odd districts may be mapped that are in the 100 km radius of the first phase districts after infrastructure is in place, he said.\r\rAlso, mandatory hallmarking of 20, 23, and 24 carats gold jewellery will be implemented in a phased manner, for which BIS is framing quality standards, he said.\r\rThere are some difficult areas, Tiwari said adding that for instance, in six northeastern states, there are no assaying centres. Such states and Union territories like Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh and Adaman &amp; Nicobar will be taken in the third phase.\r\rThe government has also relaxed mandatory gold hallmarking guidelines for some industry players.\r\rWhy&nbsp;jewellers with annual turnover of up to Rs 40 lakh per annum exempted?\r\rAsked why jewellers with an annual turnover of up to Rs 40 lakh per annum were exempted, Tiwari said this has been done so that small jewellers do not face problem in accessing assaying centers.\r\rConsumer Affairs Ministry Additional Secretary Nidhi Khare said, &quot;The rest who have left out will do voluntary registration. I hope this will be a good selling strategy to improve the credibility.&quot;\r\rBesides small jewellers, the government has also exempted those who export and re-import jewellery as per the government&#39;s trade policy, jewellery meant for international exhibitions as well as for government approved B2B domestic exhibitions.\r\rThe government has also exempted registration fee from jewellers which will be one time.\r\rTiwari said alteration in the hallmarked jewellery up to two grams of increase or decrease to be allowed with responsibility of purity on the jeweller.\r\rManufacturer, importer, wholesaler, distributor or retailer engaged in selling precious metal articles have to mandatorily get registered with BIS for hallmarking.\r\rHowever, artisans or manufacturers who are just making the gold jewellery on a job work basis for the jewellers and are not directly related to sale to anyone in the chain are exempted for registration.\r\rHallmarking should be done at the first point of sale which may be manufacturer, wholesaler, distributor or retailer, he added.\r\rMandatory hallmarking will protect public against lower caratage\r\rThe mandatory hallmarking will protect the public against lower caratage and ensure consumers do not get cheated while buying gold ornaments and get the purity as marked on the ornaments.\r\rThe BIS has been running a hallmarking scheme for gold jewellery since April 2000. Around 40 per cent of gold jewellery is being hallmarked currently. The government said there has been a 25 per cent increase in assaying and hallmarking centers to 945 from 454 in the last five years.\r\rALSO READ |&nbsp;Net Direct Tax collections for 2021-22 grow by almost 100%\r\rALSO READ |&nbsp;Coca Cola loses $4 billion after Cristiano Ronaldo removes soft drink bottles at presser\r", "Published_Date": "2021-06-16T21:02:43+05:30"},

The company has emerged as India&rsquo;s second largest telecom company. Jio, having a customer base of 30.6 crores, now trails only Vodafone-Idea. Airtel has 28.4 crore subscribers while Vodafone-Idea had announced 38.7 crore subscribers in December 2018. Airtel&rsquo;s numbers according to the report of TOI the numbers were confirmed by a spokesperson after the query was sent.\r\rAccording to a telecom industry analyst said Jio may overtake Vodafone-Idea soon. &ldquo;Vodafone-Idea is the most vulnerable of the three private players, and it may just be a matter of a few more quarters, maybe three-four, before it is overtaken by Jio,&rdquo; says the analyst.\r\rAirtel, which has been dominating&nbsp;the Indian telecom space for almost two decades, this has proved to be a major fall.&nbsp;Airtel which used to be the market leader until the middle of last year before being sidelined&nbsp;by a new entity that was formed after the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.\r\rThe growth in Jio&rsquo;s business since it launched services in September 2016, has been fuelled by aggressive and dirt-cheap tariff plans with the company launching operations with free voice call facility.\r\r&ldquo;The remarkable growth of Jio has been unprecedented and the company is expected to dominate the customer acquisition space through aggressive and innovative tariff plans, including bundling of content packages,&rdquo; said Mohan Shukla, CEO of FinXPros, a consultancy firm.\r\rJio has been adding subscribers at breakneck speed at a time when Airtel and Vodafone-Idea have been weeding out low-paying users. According to a report by JP Morgan, Jio added 2.7 crore new customers between January and March 2019, after logging in 12 crore new members through 2018.\r\rImportantly, the company continues to lead the data space through its 4G-only business, and is actively scouting for more customers with cut-throat tariffs. &ldquo;&hellip; we see no prospects of a tariff hike in FY2019-20, unless Jio&rsquo;s net addition (of subscribers) comes down,&rdquo; JM Financial said in a just-released report.\r\rJio&rsquo;s&nbsp;entry into the telecom business had unshackled the financials of the industry completely. Airtel, which had initially accused Jio of engaging in &ldquo;predatory pricing&rdquo; to gain market share, has seen its domestic operations slip into losses, while Vodafone India and Idea were forced to strike synergies and lower operating costs.\r\rHowever, Jio,&nbsp; continues to be profitable in its operations and also had the highest adjusted gross revenue (AGR) in access services amongst all the telecom companies in the December quarter. While Jio&rsquo;s AGR was Rs 9,482 crore, Vodafone-Idea was at Rs 7,224 crore and Airtel at Rs 6,440 crore, according to a report released by telecom regulator Trai.\r\rIn 2018, Jio captured 60% share of new 4G subscribers and accounted for 65% of industry 4G customers as of December-end 2018. Further, it carried 70% of 4G data traffic in 2018, and 61% of overall data traffic.\r\rMukesh Ambani had made it clear from the beginning that his business would not be a pure-play mobile telecom company, but would aim at creating a digital eco-system that &mdash; among other areas &mdash; would focus on high-speed internet, news and entertainment content, movies, music, chat, and financial transactions.\rJio has been the strongest in terms of bringing in the internet customers, especially as it also offers mobile handsets bundled with its services.\r", "Published_Date": "2019-04-25T14:36:27+05:30"},

The unions have been demanding a wage revision linked to the gross profit of the banks.\"Our demand is for a 23 per cent wage hike as against a rise of 11 per cent offered by the Indian Banks' Association (IBA),\" Utagi said.IBA is the management body of banks which is carrying out negotiations with the Government and various unions.UFBU has also demanded withdrawal of an IBA letter to member-banks on visiting their mandates given to the association for unconditional wage negotiation at industry level.IBA, in 2012, had written a letter to all its members asking them to submit a fresh mandate which will allow the body to negotiate bank-wise wage revision and the hike will be linked to the paying capacity of an individual lender.\"We will not allow bank-wise wage revision. We want an industry level negotiation,\" Utagi said.Post the January 7 strike, UFBU has decided for a complete shutdown of banking industry from January 21-24. It is also planning an indefinite strike from March 16 over the wage hike issue.The bank employees had gone on a day-long strike on the same issue in November last year. This was followed by a zone-wise strike early last month. ", "Published_Date": "2015-01-01T23:58:00+05:30"},

The move would also help banks garner more funds to meet their lending needs. \"If bank credit is not to become a constraint to growth, the real rates need to move in the direction of encouraging bank deposits\", the RBI said while raising the key policy rates by up to 50 basis points for the fifth time this year. While inflation was 8.5 per cent in August, the maximum return that banks are giving is 7.75 per cent on fixed deposits between three to 10 years. The Central Board of Trustees, the highest policy making body of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), yesterday decided to raise the interest rate on provident fund deposits for 2010-11 to 9.5 per cent from 8.5 per cent. The rate is the highest in the last five years. Some bankers have expressed the possibility of diversion of deposits to the provident fund on account of the increase in difference between the bank fixed deposit and PF rates. About a year ago when the FD rates were about 10 per cent and the PF rate was 8.5 per cent, unions demanded that the two be aligned. The RBI also said that the decision to raise short-term lending (repo) and borrowing (reverse repo) rates by 25 basis points and 50 basis points to 6 and 5 per cent, respectively, was \"motivated by the need to end the prevalence of negative real interest rates\". Negative real interest rates refer to the difference between the deposit rates and inflation. It indicates that the bank deposits have not been adequately protected against declining value of money on account of inflation. Bankers, including Bank of Maharashtra CMD Allen Pereira, Bank of Baroda Executive director R K Bakshi and Punjab and Sind Bank executive director P K Anand, opined that lenders would have to take a call on hiking interest rates in October. In July, when RBI raised repo and reverse repo rate, 40 banks raised their deposit rates and 26 lending rates. Currently, market leader State Bank of India pays 7.75 per cent on fixed deposit for 8 to 10 years, while the largest private sector bank ICICI gives similar returns on deposits with maturity period of three to 10 years. Home, auto and corporate loans are likely to become expensive from October, with bankers  saying that interest rates may be hiked next month in response to the Reserve Bank raising policy rates to tame inflation. \"In early October, interest rates could be revised and chances are there it could be revised upwards,\" Bank of Baroda's Executive Director R K Bakshi said. Bankers said they will hold on to the rates till September 30, which is the half yearly closing of the banks. High interest rates could temper demand for loans and thus curtail consumption. \"Rate of interest may have to go up. bank have to take a view at the end of the quarter. Till September 30 I do not expect any change. Pressure is there to increase rates in the near term,\" Bank of Maharashtra CMD Allen Pereira said. Short-term funds would get little costlier and there is possibility that the short-term (deposit) rates could also go up in the future, bankers said. \"Till September 30 everyone will hold on to the interest rate and following that there might be some passing on effect to customer,\" Punjab and Sind Bank executive Director P K Anand said. Central Bank of India CMD S Sridhar said, \"Bankers will adopt a calibrated approach. The examination of interest rates is on cards as cost of funds for banks is increasing.\"       ", "Published_Date": "2010-09-16T16:39:00+05:30"},

The decision comes close on the heels of various private and public sector lenders including ICICI Bank, Punjab National Bank, Syndicate Bank and Bank of India raising their deposit rates, in response to RBI Governor D Subbarao's suggestion of giving better returns to depositors.SBI, according to a official release, will offer a maximum interest rate of 8.75 per cent for deposits with maturity period of 8-10 years, marking an increase of 100 basis points.The highest increase of 150 basis points will be in case of term deposits with maturity of 46-90 days. The depositors will earn an interest of 5.5 per cent as against existing 4 per cent.The decision of SBI to raise fixed deposit rates will prompt other lender to hike their rates to compete for savers money. In an effort to tide over tight liquidity situation and increase its credit, ICICI Bank raised interest rates on fixed deposits of various tenors by 0.25-0.50 per cent.These announcements come after RBI Governor D Subbarao recently asked banks to hike deposit rates and lower lending rates, to raise the level of national savings as well as to encourage investments needed for double-digit growth.Term deposits of 91-180 days maturity will now fetch customers 6 per cent interest as compared to earlier 5.5 per cent, SBI said.For fixed deposits with a tenor between 1-year to 554 days, the new interest rate will be 7.75 per cent against the existing 7 per cent, while 555-day fixed deposits of SBI will attract an interest rate of 8.5 per cent, an increase of 100 basis points.The interest rate on term deposits of between 556 days to 2 years tenor will go up by 50 basis points to 7.75 per cent from tomorrow, while interest on the 2 years to 999 days maturity slab has been increased by 75 basis points to 8.25 per cent.Even rate on 1,000 days fixed deposit scheme goes up up 75 basis points to 8.5 per cent compared to existing 7.75 per cent.Interest rate on term deposit between 3-10 years maturity slabs goes up by 100 basis points or one per cent each.Last week, SBI Chairman O P Bhatt had said, \"If credit growth picks up, more deposits can be attracted into the banking system by better pricing which is beginning to happen...In the current situation, they (deposit rates) can only go up. \"On the lending rates, Bhatt had said the bank will take a call only in next month as it has already increased its newly introduced benchmark lending rate -- base rate, below which banks can't lend -- once this quarter.

The entire year revolved around the individualistic nature of women as well as what they aspire to be. The latter half of the year particularly consolidated four fashionable pillars. The AW Macro trends roared on the bases of women&rsquo;s personalities like confidence, vulnerability , sophistication, or elegance among others, different reactions emerging from the movements like &quot;me too&quot; etc.\r\rThe Big Bang: The trend represented the &lsquo;Ideal woman&rsquo; &ndash; the quintessential independent, confident, and fearless woman who imbued empowerment. One who is undeterred by anything on the face of this earth; an epitome of strength.\r\rCocoon: A complete contrast to the big bang, the trend catered to the women who wanted to feel protected. They would layer themselves up as a symbol of protection from any threats or any negative influences.\r\rMadame: Derived from an exemplary classy, elegant, and sophisticated lady who would always stay spic and span, prim and proper! The most feminine women who would never fail to dot their i&rsquo;s and cross their t&rsquo;s.\r\rNostalgia: This fourth pillar was more about a feeling rather than a personality trait. It was about women simply refusing to accept the present, rather wishing to travel back in time to relive the 70s through fashion. It was hence about reminiscing &lsquo;the old days&rsquo;.\r\rThese pillars gave way for a handful of global fashion trends that were beautifully complemented with equally fashionable jewellery.\r\rWhite Edge: The trend was adopted by the powerful yet a feminine woman. The pant-suit combination was the preferred attire which induced an opinionated social message of women empowerment. Hence, the Sumer-Spring trend was predominately about white suiting that displayed power and panache. This was invariably complemented with minimalistic yet edgy jewellery in gold with sophisticated white enamel work.\r\r\r\rFringe Shimmer: A choice of attire that lasted throughout the year that implied fun, movement, and individuality in varying degrees. Hence, they were perfect for festive occasions and cocktail parties. Apart from fringe jewellery, the swishy effect offered by the long and soft threads of tassel earrings very much complimented this style.\r\r\r\rFlower Bouquet: Floral attires that were feminine yet colourful became the go-to chic option for fashionable women. Floral shirts and tees were matched with light coloured denims and sneakers to offer a more casual look. On the other hand, similar floral designs offered a different dimension when used for dresses; a mainstay in spring. The trend was interpreted in multi-hued enamel floral jewellery.\r\r\r\rDisco Sequin: The classic disco style of the 60s became a wardrobe staple. The dials of the clock were initially rewound to 2015; however there was break the next year. The trend saw a comeback in 2017 in different avatars becoming a must-have look for the modern woman. Sequin thus inspired addition of bling with gold jewellery dedicated for day as well as evening wear. &nbsp;\r\r\r\rAnimal Print: The focus on preserving nature and wildlife was displayed in fabric prints. The fall trend headlined various fashion shows to transpose tiger and leopards to the urban jungle. They were complemented beautifully with bold and colourful gemstones, earrings, bangles, as well as necklaces.\r\r\r\rThough the year is almost over, the fashion and jewellery world has given us lots to savour. Bold is beautiful wasn&rsquo;t the only norm; versatility, colour, and print took the world by storm!\r\r(The article is authored by Deepshikha Gupta, Senior VP - Design, Melorra)\r", "Published_Date": "2019-01-09T17:07:20+05:30"},

The power equipment major had posted a net profit of Rs 6,615 crore in 2012-13, BHEL said on Saturday.  The state-owned major's turnover declined to Rs 40,366 crore from Rs 50,156 crore in 2012-13, as per a regulatory filing on its provisional earnings for the year ended March 31, 2014.  “Profit impact is due to low volumes.

The rising trend of debtors has also been arrested,” it added.  BHEL said improved focus on project execution enabled it to “record highest ever commissioning/synchronization of 13,452 MW of power plants in domestic and international markets in 2013-14.”  Last month, Life Insurance Corp purchased a more than 4 per cent stake in BHEL from the government after a decision taken by an Empowered Group of Ministers.  BHEL's parent ministry, the Heavy Industry and Public Enterprises Ministry, had opposed a proposed disinvestment of shares in the company by the government on account of choppy market conditions.  The government held a 63.06 per cent stake in BHEL at the end of March. ", "Published_Date": "2014-04-06T16:11:00+05:30"},

Recognising the cost-to-company model and revamping these labour laws would greatly benefit youth, increase formal employment and accelerate voluntary migration,\" Rituparna Chakraborty, Convenor of the Petition & Co-Founder of TeamLease, said.Currently, in a cost to-company model informal employees can take home their entire salary while employees in the organised sector \"lose\" a part of their earnings to schemes like PF, Employees State Insurance (ESI), Professional Tax, Employees Pension Scheme, statutory bonus and gratuity, TeamLease said.Hence most choose informal employment where gross and net salaries are the same.According to TeamLease, India's labour laws mandate the highest salary deductions for low wage employees in the world; in a cost-to-company world this can mean an almost 44.31 per cent salary deduction for low wage employees, while it is only 5.32 per cent for high wage employees.Nearly 100 per cent of the net job creation over the last two decades has taken place in the informal sector and we have 90 per cent informal employment overall, the report said adding that by recognising and offering employees the right to choose their take home pay will increase the share of our formal labour force.", "Published_Date": "2015-01-07T11:07:00+05:30"},

Earlier, it was Rs 5,000.In view of  above changes, the government has proposed to amend the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. The amendment bill is likely to be introduced in the upcoming Budget Session, slated to commence from February 23.It is also proposed to reduce the threshold limit of workers for coverage under the Act. At present firms which have employed 20 or more employees are covered under the legislations which would be reduced to 10 workers. Reduction in the threshold limit of workers is expected to bring 50 lakh more employees under the purview of Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO).There are approximately 4.5 crore employees of public and private sector companies under the EPFO.", "Published_Date": "2015-01-22T14:03:00+05:30"},

In West Bengal, polling today in the six seats was crucial for both Left Front which had won them five years ago and Trinamool Congress desperate to wrest them.Notable among the 72 nominees are nine-time MP CPI(M)'s Basudeb Acharia facing the challenge of actress Moonmoon Sen of Trinamool Congress from Bankura, singer Babul Suprio of BJP from Asansol and another actress of yesteryears Sandhya Roy of Trinamool Congress from Midnapore.In Bihar, high-profile constituencies Saran and Hajipur, where Paswan is in fray, recorded 56 per cent turnout each, Sheohar registered 55.5 per cent voting, Sitamarhi 54 per cent, Muzaffarpur 61.92 per cent and Maharajganj 53 per cent, Two seats in Himachal Pradesh, one of them being contested in by Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh's wife Pratibha Singh, witnessed 65 percent polling closely followed by 62 per cent in the four seats of Uttarakhand.Two seats in Jammu and Kashmir registered a turnout of close to 50 per cent.
